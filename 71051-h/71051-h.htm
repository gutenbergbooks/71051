<p>The Prince-Bishop at last decided to start
for Paris. He had hardly arrived when he
received a visit from Madame de Pailly, who
informed him of his niece’s inclinations, and
explained to him the progress of affairs. The
Bishop earnestly requested to see the Princesse
de Ligne-Luxembourg herself, but at
that moment she was staying with Madame
de Brionne at her country place of Limours.
Madame de Pailly at once resumes her pen:—</p>

<p>“The Prince-Bishop, Madame, is always
inquiring whether you have returned; he is
extremely desirous to have the honour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
seeing you, and I should be very glad if you
could seriously discuss the matter with him.</p>

<p>“Occasions on which I can prove to you my
zeal and entire devotion will not be wanting
with so vacillating a mind; you will be able to
say through me anything you please. I will
see to everything, and render you a faithful
account of what happens. But it seems to
me that we must settle between ourselves
what is to be the point of departure. He
has referred several times to the question
of settlements, especially with regard to the
present. Would it not be better to present
him with a copy of the deed of property? It
would hurry on the transaction, and be a wise
measure.</p>

<p>“The Prince de Salm’s agents are very
active; he constantly alludes to him, and he
listens to my replies as if they were quite
new to him; he goes on confiding to my ear
all the proposals that are made to him. We
have three fresh rivals, who, for the present,
however, give me no anxiety.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>The desired explanations at last arrived
from Brussels, in the following letter:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">The Princesse de Ligne-Lichtenstein to
the Princesse de Ligne-Luxembourg.</span></p>

<p>“I trust, Princess, you do not doubt the
tenderness of my feelings towards you; the
gratitude I now owe you can only increase
it.</p>

<p>“I have the honour to enclose the paper
concerning M. de Ligne’s property. For
the last year he has put all his affairs into my
hands, and as I sign everything and collect
all the revenues, and M. de Ligne even
gives me the receipts for the money he draws
from the estates, I can guarantee the exactness
of the document.</p>

<p>“I am too sure of my husband’s affection
for you, Princess, and the confidence he has
in your judgment, not to feel certain that
he will agree to any arrangement you may
choose to make for his son. I beg to entreat
you, Madame, in case you should think an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
income of twenty-five thousand livres<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> not
sufficient for the present, to fix the sum yourself,
for I only require one more year to
settle the affairs of our house (public opinion
having kindly reported that they were in a
much more confused state than I found them
to be). I can promise you to honour any
arrangements and liabilities that you will
undertake for our young people. All they
will have to do when they draw their income
every three months will be to sign
their names. I have made it a rule in business
to consider as sacred the dates on which
income or pensions fall due.</p>

<p>“The affection I bear towards my children
leading me perhaps to overlook their faults,
it would ill become me to praise our son, but
I must believe the testimony of those who
knew him at Strasburg during several years;
and at the present moment we have every
reason to be satisfied with the character he
bears in the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“Pray, therefore, do not relax your kindness
towards him, and let your efforts conduce to
his happiness. You will also be contributing towards
mine, for to see him settled and to be surrounded
by my children will be my greatest joy.</p>

<p>“Receive, Princess, the assurance of my
deepest respect and esteem,” etc. etc.</p>
</div>

<p>This letter had a wonderful effect on the
uncle, but did not move his niece.</p>

<p>“The young lady,” writes Madame de
Pailly, “is infatuated with M. de Salm; he
has some emissary about her whom we do not
know, and who demolishes beforehand all we
can say against him. Even the Comte de Horn’s
name has been brought forward as an honour,
on account of the Regent’s phrase<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> about him.</p>

<p>“The good uncle feels his own weakness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
and carefully endeavours to hide it;
he has agreed to everything with me, and,
as I have been fortunate enough to persuade
him, he fancies I shall have the same
success with his niece, as if they were in the
same frame of mind. To-day he is going
to use all his influence, and at the same time
inform her of the visit he wishes me to make,
and of the entire trust he desires she should
have in me. I shall lend myself to all his
wishes, and shall have the honour of sending
you a report of this interview. Receive, I
pray,” etc.</p>

<p>The uncle did not meet with the slightest
success in his efforts to overcome his niece’s
resistance. Madame de Pailly was obliged
to confess it to her correspondent: “There
is one point, Madame, on which I think
you will be obliged to give way; the Bishop
asserts that he can only overcome his niece’s
passionate wish to be married in Paris by
pledging his word that she shall spend three
winters there under your guidance, so as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
get accustomed to the fashionable world. He
appears to attach great importance to this
promise; for he feels the great advantage it
would be to his niece. You still have time,
Madame, to think over this matter, for we
can discuss the other points in the meantime;
I will tell you what they are when I
see you....”</p>

<p>The Princesse de Ligne kept her nephew
informed of all these negotiations; as for the
Prince’s father, he was still detained with the
army, waiting for peace to be signed. Prince
Charles wrote a short cold note to his aunt, in
which he did not even allude to his marriage:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Aunt</span>—Although peace has
been declared the Congress is not yet over;
my father is very displeased at it; he is still
in a wretched village, feeling very dull, with
nothing to do.</p>

<p>“He will certainly go to Paris as soon as he
can; I envy him the pleasure he will have in
seeing you, my dear aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Allow me to assure you from time to time
of the feelings of affection and respect with
which I remain all my life,” etc. etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The coolness the Prince displayed will be
easily understood when we learn that he already
felt for a friend of his childhood a love
which was never completely effaced. But, accustomed
as he was absolutely to respect the
paternal or rather the <i>maternal</i> will, it never
entered his mind for one moment not to
obey.</p>

<p>His mother had eagerly agreed to their
cousin’s plans. Hélène’s large fortune, the isolated
position of the young girl, which would
tend to make her adopt her husband’s family
as her own, had quite won over the Princess,
who ignored or pretended to ignore her
son’s secret affection. She therefore persevered
in her efforts, hoping to succeed, though
the object in view was not easy to attain.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Wilna had been won over
to the de Lignes, but he had many a hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
battle to fight, for an unforeseen circumstance
had strengthened Hélène’s resolution not to
leave Paris. Her friend, Mademoiselle de
Lauraguais, had married the Duc Auguste
d’Aremberg, cousin of the de Lignes, who,
like him, resided for part of the year at the
Court of Brussels. The young Duchess returned
to Paris for some time, and at once
visited her former companions at the Abbaye-aux-Bois.
She had heard of Prince Charles’
proposed marriage, and gave Hélène a most
gloomy description of life in Brussels. The
latter immediately repeated this to her uncle,
making the picture several shades darker.
The poor Bishop did not know who to listen
to; in the midst of his perplexities he
determined to despatch the Abbé Baudeau,
who was always at hand, to Bel Œil,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> giving
him instructions to confer verbally with the
Princesse de Ligne on the delicate subject of
a residence in Paris, as well as on the money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
question. He was allowed great latitude on
this latter point, and accordingly set off.</p>

<p>Madame de Pailly lost no time, and again
wrote to the Princesse de Ligne-Luxembourg:
“We have had news of the envoy, Madame,
and we hear he is much pleased with everything,
but he sends word that Madame la
Princesse de Ligne will not hear of a three
years’ residence in Paris.</p>

<p>“The Bishop appeared to me very much
disturbed at the effect this would have on his
niece, as she had always held to this condition.
You know there is nothing more
difficult to overcome than the fancies of a
young person, and unfortunately she has been
confirmed in this one by all that Madame
d’Aremberg de Lauraguais has told her.
The Abbé will arrive perhaps to-day; I shall
be there, and we will first work upon the
uncle, so as to make him work upon his
niece.</p>

<p>“M. de Salm will not give way; he has
sent his picture to his friend at the Convent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and she has invited the Princess Hélène to a
collation, given in a room of which this portrait
forms the chief ornament.</p>

<p>“I was at the opera with a lady who is
much interested in this fine gentleman, and
she said: ‘What does it signify whether you
are a scamp or not when you have a name
and a large fortune? Look, for instance, at
so and so,’ etc.</p>

<p>“God forbid that such morality should
enter the head of our prelate and his niece.
In the meantime I amused myself last night
by quietly challenging my free-spoken young
friend to tell me all the naughty stories about
this charming Prince. The good Bishop bore
it with a slightly embarrassed air, which quite
amused me.</p>

<p>“I shall have the honour, Madame, to give
you an account of the envoy’s return, and of
all its consequences. I beg you not to be
impatient, and to rely on my zeal and my
intense desire to do all that is agreeable to
you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Receive,” etc.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Abbé returned,
and, though he had not succeeded in obtaining
the promise of a residence in Paris,
he had done much to push the matter forward.
He brought magnificent fruit and flowers to
the young Princess from Bel Œil, and in the
description he gave of the almost regal magnificence
of the place he neglected none of
the details which were likely to charm and
flatter her vanity. He had granted handsome
pecuniary conditions, and the Princess,
on her part, had seemed disposed to accept
the marriage-contract proposed by the
Abbé.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame de Pailly to the Princesse de
Ligne-Luxembourg.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All is going on wonderfully well, Madame;
you will find the Prince and his envoy very
well satisfied. At dinner we had a melon
from Bel Œil, and peaches were sent to the
Princess Hélène. I proposed the health of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
the giver; but they will tell you the rest. I
am rejoiced at the position of affairs.</p>

<p>“The Abbé may have every possible fault,
but he confirms me in my opinion that one
can do nothing with fools and everything
with intelligent people. The young Princess
is converted, and her good uncle, agreeing to
the Abbé’s expedient, says: ‘It will cost
me thirty thousand livres<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a year more to
make my niece happy. I will do it, Madame,
if only you are satisfied.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The Princesse de Ligne-Luxembourg
wrote to her cousin to give her this good
news, and to urge her to come to Paris as
soon as possible; but she was in no hurry,
and, like a prudent mother, wished above all,
to settle everything relating to the income and
household arrangements of the future young
couple, for whom she dreaded certain temptations,
from which she herself had suffered.
She again sent her steward to Paris with two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
letters, one of which was a confidential one to
her cousin.</p>

</p>

<p>“I despatch you my steward, Princess;
he will have the honour of handing you this
letter, and I have instructed him to carry
out exactly whatever you are kind enough to
order.</p>

<p>“The Prince arrived at Vienna on the 5th
of June; I therefore think he will soon be
home again, in which case I should only
go to Paris with him, or even a couple of
days later, if I can possibly avoid going
before.</p>

<p>“In any case, Princess, I shall await your
orders. I reserve myself the pleasure of
assuring you personally of all my gratitude.
I have never doubted the success of anything
which you were good enough to take
in hand.</p>

<p>“As our young people will not have to
receive, and as the ordinary expenses of the
household cannot possibly absorb all their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
income, I fear that too large a fortune may
be hurtful to them, and lead perhaps to
gambling, or other extravagances, which
would do them harm, and which they
would always consider themselves obliged
to increase in proportion to their income;
especially when they will come into their
respective fortunes. I look at this matter
from a mother’s point of view. Pray do not
let it go beyond the family.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Princesse de Ligne-Luxembourg told
the Bishop of her cousin’s wise advice, but
no attention was paid to it. The Congress of
Teschen was over, and the Prince de Ligne
was returning home slowly, for he always
found much to delay him on the road. We
will not inquire into the nature of these
delays; he, however, found sufficient time
to write a few lines from Vienna to his
cousin, and to the Bishop of Wilna, which
he had neglected doing for the last two
months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">To the Princesse de Ligne-Luxembourg.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am told, Princess, that, thanks to your
kindness, all is going on well, also that you
have done me the honour of writing to
me.... I have not received anything.
They say I must write to the Bishop. I beg
you will give him the enclosed letter.</p>

<p>“If you have any commands to give
me, address them to the Post Office at
Munich; I shall find them in passing
through.</p>

<p>“All the information I receive from Poland
appears to coincide with our views.</p>

<p>“I place myself at your feet, Princess, and
beg to assure you that my gratitude is equal
to my tender and respectful attachment.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Le Prince de Ligne.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>A few days after the receipt of this letter
they had agreed upon all points; a draft of
the settlement was drawn up, and the Princesse
de Ligne and her son announced
their arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>In spite of the very small inclination the
young Prince felt for this marriage, he experienced
a certain curiosity to see his future
bride. As for Hélène, she was far more interested
in her outfit, her presents, and her
diamonds than in her husband. Among
other things, she had been promised “certain
girandoles<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and diamond bracelets of wonderful
beauty—old family jewels, that she was
most impatient to see, and she was in a
great fright lest they should be left behind
at Brussels.” Her future aunt undertook to
explain this childlike anxiety to the wife of
the steward, so that she might remind the
Princess to bring these precious trinkets.
She answered as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On my return home I found a letter
from the Princess, announcing her immediate
arrival, and adding that she is bringing
with her the girandoles and the bracelets;
so the Princesse Hélène need have no cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
for anxiety. I shall have the honour of paying
her my respects on Monday. We have
also heard, through M. le Comte Tasson, that
M. le Prince de Ligne will reach Brussels,
at the latest, on Monday. I hasten to apprise
your Highness of the fact, and beg she will
accept the assurance of deepest respect,” etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The Princesse de Ligne’s first visit was
to her cousin. She there found the Prince-Bishop
awaiting her arrival. After a long
conversation and endless compliments on
either side, it was settled that the Bishop
should escort the Princess and her son to
the Abbaye-aux-Bois.</p>

<p>Hélène, who had been warned the day
before, was very much vexed at having to
make her first appearance in her school dress;
but no exception could be made to the rule.
She went down to the parlour accompanied
by Madame de Sainte Delphine, and very soon
perceived that the plainness of her dress did
not prevent the Prince from thinking her very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
pretty. Though she pretended to cast her
eyes modestly down during the visit, she took
care to see enough of her future husband to
be able to say to her companions on returning:
“He is fair, has a tall slight figure, and resembles
his mother, who is very handsome;
he has a noble mien, but he is too serious, and
there is something German about him!”</p>

<p>The Prince’s father arrived three days
later.</p>

<p>“I abandon M. de Ligne to your indignation,
Princess,” his wife writes to their cousin;
“you may prepare her for his arrival, which
will certainly be either to-day or to-morrow;
it fills me with the greatest joy!”</p>

<p>The Prince-father had his head completely
turned by his future daughter-in-law, who did
all she could to please him, intuitively feeling
that he was the one with whom she could
best sympathise.</p>

<p>Having no family in Paris, it was decided
that Hélène’s marriage should be celebrated
in the chapel of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
great delight of the pupils. The Bishop gave
his niece an outfit worth a hundred thousand
écus;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the wedding casket, offered by the
Lignes, was provided by Léonard; the laces,
ordered at Brussels and Mechlin, were real
masterpieces of work. The jewels offered to
Hélène, besides the family diamonds and the
famous girandoles, were chosen by herself at
Barrière’s and at Drey’s. She gave a trinket
to each of her companions in the red class,
and a magnificent luncheon, <i>with ices</i>, was
given by the Prince-Bishop to all the pupils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
including the <i>little blues</i>, who each received
in addition a bag of sweetmeats.</p>

<p>The marriage-contract was signed at Versailles
by their Majesties and the royal family,
the 25th of July 1779. The wedding took
place on the 29th at the Abbaye-aux-Bois.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that Hélène’s nurse,
Mademoiselle Bathilde Toutevoix, took part
in the festivities. She adorned her pretty
mistress to the very best of her ability, and
the poor girl’s head was so completely turned
with joy that she even forgot her cockades.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
She came down to the parlour after the bride,
and modestly hid herself in a corner. Prince
Charles approached her, and slipped into her
hand his wedding present—an annuity of six
hundred livres.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Hélène was much touched
with this attention. “I thanked him,” she
says, “by a smile and pressure of the hand,
the first I had granted him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>The bride was led to the altar by her
uncle, and by the Marquise Wielopolska, who
took the place of her mother. The Duchesses
de Choiseul, de Mortemart, de Châtillon,
de la Vallière, etc., were present at the
ceremony. The young Princess, exquisitely
lovely in her bridal dress, fully satisfied the
company by her “decent attitude, which was
full of feeling” (style of that day). After
receiving the congratulations of the brilliant
assembly, Hélène went up to her apartment
to change her costume; but, instead of returning
immediately to the parlour, she quickly
made her way to the choir chapel, where
Madame de Rochechouart was buried, and
kneeling on the tomb of the one who had
been to her as a mother, she offered up to
God her last girlish prayer. When she returned
to the parlour she was rather pale, and
her eyes showed signs of tears; but at the
gates of the Abbey a post-chaise, drawn
by six chafing horses, was awaiting; the
postilions, in the pink and silver livery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the Prince, being scarcely able to hold them;
Hélène, after a rapid farewell, was hurried
into the carriage by her young husband, and
they started at full gallop for Brussels.</p>

Mogylani, an estate with a residence and country-houses, two
palaces at Cracow and one at Warsaw. Prince Radziwill owed the
Massalski family a sum of one million eight hundred thousand Polish
florins, inherited through Hélène’s mother. He had given them as
interest three important estates, of which half the income belonged
to Hélène, and the other half to her brother. The Prince-Bishop

<p>The young couple first established themselves
at Bel Œil, the magnificent summer residence
of the Prince de Ligne. The Marshal was
passionately attached to this regal abode, on
which his father had lavished several millions.
The property was composed of a succession
of gardens, forests, parks, mansions,
and shooting boxes, which the Prince de
Ligne had designed with the most perfect
taste. It was here that he preferred receiving
his guests, and that he successively
entertained the Prince de Condé, the King
of Sweden, the Comte d’Artois, Prince Henry
of Prussia, etc. Hélène was dazzled by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
splendour of her new abode. A brilliant
reception had been prepared in her honour.
On the very day after her arrival, which
had taken place in the evening, the young
Princess, on opening her windows, perceived
an immense park full of villagers elegantly
attired as shepherds and shepherdesses, their
dresses more like those of Watteau and
Lancret than those commonly worn by the
Flemish peasants. The Prince’s dragoons
were making merry at tables on the lawn;
and a little farther off, in a grove, might
be seen puppet shows, in another tight-rope
dancers; a rural ballroom was established on
a green sward; under a leafy bower a magician
was distributing sham ointments in
little boxes, which contained sweetmeats and
trinkets. In another spot a bard was gaily
reciting verses, composed by the Prince in
honour of the newly-married pair; and if the
composition was not brilliant in versification,
it yet could boast of grace and art sufficient
to compensate for its defects; finally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Aufresne and Préville, who had arrived that
same morning from Paris, were playing improvised
proverbs in the private theatre of the
residence. The festivities lasted the whole
day; after dinner the proverbs were replaced
by a comedy in one act, with interludes of song,
entitled, <i>Colette and Lucas</i>, composed by the
Prince de Ligne in honour of his daughter-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The audience was composed of
brilliant officers and fine ladies, who had come
expressly from Brussels and even Versailles
for the occasion. The play, though worthless,
was courteously applauded; but another had
been prepared in order to compensate the
spectators. Night having come on during
the representation, sudden floods of light
springing up in brilliant sheaves between
the trees greeted the guests as they emerged
from the theatre, and in the thickets fairy-like
illuminations lit up the arbours; it was impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to see the lamps, cleverly hidden
under the foliage. “It was not night,” says
Hélène: “it was silvery daylight.”</p>

<p>The married couple appeared enchanted
one with the other, with a shade more of
tenderness on the part of the Prince. Hélène’s
beauty, grace, and intelligence surprised and
charmed him; he had not expected to find
these qualities united in the person of a child
of fifteen. Every one was under the same
impression, and the Dowager-Princess herself,
who was not easy to please, wrote as follows,
some time after the wedding, to the Princesse
de Ligne-Luxembourg:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Bel Œil</span>, <i>20th August 1779</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“Again I renew my thanks, Princess, and
reiterate the expressions of gratitude I owe
you. Our child is most charming, docile, and
gentle, having no will of her own, and amused
at everything; in fact all that could be desired
in a daughter-in-law if she were moulded by
one’s self. She has been quite a success with
all who have seen her in these parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“As our children have both had the honour
of writing to you, I will not, for fear of repetition,
give you the details of our journey.
Moreover, his Grace the Bishop of Wilna
will have told you all; he appeared himself
very well pleased with our country. Do
try, Princess, to make him send my son his
niece’s portrait, in whatever style he prefers,
even if it be that little pencil drawing we saw
at the Abbaye-aux-Bois; and do not doubt,
Princess, of the tender sentiments,” etc.
etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince-Bishop had indeed been
delighted with his stay in Flanders; the
amiability of the family of Ligne, the harmonious
relationship existing between its
members, the distinguished intelligence and
the kindness of Prince Charles in particular,
all contributed to assure him of his niece’s
future happiness. He left her thoroughly
satisfied.</p>

<p>For the first time Hélène was going to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
acquainted with family life; she could not
have had a better beginning, for the Lignes
lived together with an intimacy full of ease,
gaiety, and tenderness. In her convent life
the little Princess, with the selfishness natural
to children, had only thought of herself, and
was not accustomed to the daily sacrifices
made by brothers and sisters, which are
made easy and rewarded by a mother’s approval
and kiss. She had a serious apprenticeship
to undergo. She preferred her
father-in-law and the Princess Clary, her
sister-in-law, to all the other members of her
family. The Princess Clary, the Prince’s
eldest and favourite daughter, “his masterpiece,”
as he called her, was kindness, grace,
and affability itself. Married some four years,
gifted with sound judgment and perfect tact,
she would have been an affectionate and
charming guide to her young sister-in-law at
the outset of her married life; but it was not
possible for her to assume this position, which
naturally devolved upon the Princess-mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
who, jealous of her rights, would have ceded
her authority to no one.</p>

<p>The Princesse de Ligne played an important
part, if not in the heart of her husband,
at least in his household. The Prince
willingly rendered justice to his wife’s qualities;
he was full of consideration for her,
and treated her always with amiable deference.
“My wife,” he said, “is an excellent
wife, full of delicacy, feeling, nobility, and
in no way selfish. She is often in a pet,
but her temper soon passes away, melting
in tears and leaving no trace, for my wife
has an excellent heart.” It was not difficult
for the Prince to resign himself to his wife’s
temper, for it affected him very slightly.
Such was not the case with her children;
it must, however, be admitted that she had
often good cause for her unevenness of temper.
Not only was her husband constantly and
openly faithless to her, but he also squandered
his fortune, and in spite of the large
revenues he possessed would often have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
been involved in serious difficulties had it
not been for the watchful care of the Princess,
who by her clever administration established
a proper balance between their income
and expenditure. However, in spite of the
Princess’s rather uncertain temper, the unvarying
cheerfulness and good humour of the
Prince made it a delightful home, for he
possessed the rare quality of being as charming
at home as in society.</p>

<p>Hélène thoroughly enjoyed her new life,
and eagerly threw herself into the pursuit of
pleasures entirely new to a little schoolgirl. She
at once learnt to ride. Dressed in an elegant
riding-habit, made to display her delicate and
supple figure to perfection, and accompanied
by her husband, she would spring into the
saddle the first thing in the morning, as light
as a bird, and as pleased with her liberty;
then three or four times a day, with childlike
glee, she would array herself in new dresses
from Léonard or Mademoiselle Bertin; and
we may be sure that they in no way resembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the little black convent-frock. At all the
entertainments given in honour of her
wedding, she fascinated everybody by her
grace and liveliness; she danced with such
spirit, acted so naturally and with so much
animation, sang with a voice so youthful and
fresh, that her husband, though not sharing
her worldly tastes, was happy in her pleasure,
and allowed her to give herself up to it without
restraint.</p>

<p>Immediately after her arrival Hélène was
presented at the Court of the Netherlands.
The Ligne family possessed a magnificent
palace at Brussels, near the Cathedral of
Sainte Gudule, and often resided there during
the winter. At that time the Viceroy was
Prince Charles of Lorraine; he had married
the Archduchess Marie-Anne,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> sister of Marie-Thérèse,
and was now a widower.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>
<p>The Prince of Lorraine often came to
hunt at Bel Œil. “He could not help being
kind, even in his fits of temper, which were
rare. One day, for instance, while hunting, on
which occasion he gave himself the airs of
an old huntsman, enraged at a number of
people who disturbed the hunt by overrunning
the forest at Bel Œil, he called out:
‘Go to the devil!—if you please, gentlemen,’
he added, taking off his hat.”</p>

<p>The liveliest, wittiest, and most fashionable
man at the Court of Brussels was certainly the
Prince de Ligne’s father, and he enjoyed his
life there extremely. “It was,” he says, “a
nice Court, gay and at the same time secure,
idle and agreeable, with plenty of drinking
and hunting.” However, when the Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
held a levee, and invited ladies, nothing but
the most inoffensive gaiety was permitted, for
the Prince hated all license and bad taste.</p>

<p>Prince Charles’s palace at Brussels was
an immense and ancient building. Brussels
reminded one somewhat of Paris, the town
offering every kind of resource. The <i>cours</i>
was the favourite promenade, and there the
grandest equipages were to be seen. The
coachbuilders of Brussels were famous, and
the Duke was anxious that the nobility
should possess the most elegant specimens of
their work. Hélène made her first appearance
on the <i>cours</i> in a superb gilt coach
made by Simon; all the panels were delicately
painted, in the most beautiful <i>vernis
Martin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> by clever Viennese artists.</p>

<p>In spite of his love for the Court of
Brussels and his passion for Bel Œil, the
Prince never stayed very long at either; he
generally started off at a moment’s notice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
“What a charming existence mine was, in
my dear and delightful Bel Œil. In twenty-four
hours’ time I could be either in Paris
or in London, at the Hague, at Spa, etc.
Once I went to Paris to spend one hour
there, and another hour at Versailles, after
the Queen’s last confinement: <i>I saw her on
the fourth day</i>,” he carefully adds.</p>

<p>“On another occasion I took all my company
there to the opera in a coach of my own.”</p>

<p>It was natural that the Prince should like
Paris and Versailles, for he was the soul and
life of the little intimate circle around the
Queen; his presence gave animation to
everything, and his invariable good humour
and sallies of wit always secured him a
smiling welcome. He was to be seen
everywhere, arranging or disarranging the
gardens; presiding at entertainments and
directing the illuminations: he took part
in the Queen’s lansquenet, Mesdames’
cavagnole, Monsieur’s whist, the Prince de
Condé’s quinze, the King’s game of billiards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
and the Prince de Conti’s pharaon.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He
said everything that came into his head; but
although he gave way to much exaggerated
merriment, from time to time, under cover of
a joke, he would make many serious truths
acceptable.</p>

<p>His great friends were the Polignacs,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
whose intimate society consisted of the
Coignys, the Conflans, the Comte de
Vaudreuil, and the Chevalier de l’Isle. He
always defended the Polignacs against the
numerous accusations which were brought
against them.</p>

<p>He writes: “There is no one more
virtuous and more disinterested than all
these Jules, but their company was sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
monotonous, so great was their fear of
giving rise to prating and gossip; the Comtesse
Diane was the only one whose conversation
was at all lively.”</p>

<p>The Prince was particularly intimate with
the Chevalier de l’Isle,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the least known
member of the little circle. The Chevalier
was an excellent officer, an encyclopedist, and
a poet, a correspondent of Voltaire<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and also
of the Prince de Ligne, who held him in
great esteem. He was a master of song, and
reigned supreme in the art of letter-writing.
He had never composed a faulty verse, or
written a letter that was not both witty and
in excellent style; however, in society he
was wanting both in good taste and breeding,
giving way to ill-temper and familiarity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
So as to make believe that he dined with the
Queen at the Polignacs on Sundays, he would
arrive the first after dinner, that those who
came after him should be deceived by this
manœuvre. He wrote regularly to the
Prince about all that went on at Versailles
during his absence. The following is an
example of his letters:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>16th January 1780.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“What a turkey we have just eaten at the
Comtesse Diane’s! My goodness, what a
fine bird! M. de Poix had sent it from the
poultry-yard. There were eight of us round
it: the lady of the house, Madame la
Comtesse Jules, Madame d’Henin, and
Madame de la Force; M. le Comte d’Artois,
M. de Vaudreuil, the Chevalier de Crussol,
and myself.</p>

<p>“While we were eating the turkey, but
without reference to it, some one mentioned
you, my Prince. Stay, let me recall who it
was? A lady——no; a man—yes, certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
a man, for he said <i>Charlot</i>, and our ladies
are not given to such familiarities. It was
the man who was on Madame la Comtesse
Jules’ left hand. Let me see; I was next
to the poet; here sat the Chevalier de
Crussol, and there M. de Vaudreuil, and
then——Ah! now I’ve got it, it was M.
le Comte d’Artois; yes, I am sure of it now.
He said: ‘By the bye, who can tell me if
Charlot has arrived at Brussels?’—‘I can,
your Highness, for I have received four lines
in his own handwriting, and am myself going
to write to him; who has any message
to send?’ All immediately answered in a
chorus: ‘I have, I have, I have.’ In the
confusion I could distinguish these words:
‘I embrace him, I love him; tell him to
come, we expect him.’ When the hubbub
had subsided the soft voice of Madame la
Comtesse Jules commenced more audibly:
‘Tell him that if he had dated his last letter
more distinctly, I would not have failed to
answer it; but that, although assisted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
several experts in the art of deciphering, it
was impossible for me even to suspect from
what place it had been written, and consequently
to what place I should direct my own.’</p>

<p>“Thereupon we conversed about you,
and then about Admiral Keppel, then
of the turkey, then of the capture of
our two frigates, then of the Spanish Inquisition,
then of a large gruyere cheese
which our ambassador in Switzerland has
just sent his children, then of the strange
conduct of the Spaniards towards us, and
at last of Mademoiselle Théodore, who,
upon my life, dances better than ever, and
who pleased us yesterday as much by her
talent as Mademoiselle Cécile by her youthful
charms. To-morrow the Queen will
receive for the first time; till now she has
only seen those who have the ‘<i>petites entrées</i>’;
she is rather thinner, but otherwise
her health leaves nothing to be desired.
The King is still the good husband, the good
father, and the good man he has always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
been; it is impossible to be near him without
admiring him as the personification of
honesty, and without being sincerely attached
to his person. I assure you we are fortunate
in possessing such a royal couple: may God
preserve them on the throne where His goodness
has placed them!... We are all going
to-morrow to Paris to inaugurate the charming
little house M. le Duc de Coigny has
bought, and in which we shall have——What
do you think we shall have?——Our
first grand entertainment—a regular
house-warming. We shall have farces, proverbs,
verses, songs, and pleasures of all
kinds; it will be a beautiful ceremony.</p>

<p>“<i>À propos</i> of verses: you have not seen
those I wrote the other day for the Queen,
threatening to play her the trick she most
dreads—that is, to name her at the opera
ball. Here it is:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Dans ce temple ou l’incognito</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Règne avec la folie,</div>

<p>“I implore you, Prince, my very dear
Prince, do not massacre my song in
honouring me by singing it yourself; leave
that care to my cousin, who will give it its
full value; love her for me, and tell her I
shall go to Brussels, on my head if necessary,
to see her; you must love me, both of you.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Queen was an object of devotion
to the Prince de Ligne. “Who could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
see the unfortunate Marie Antoinette without
adoring her?” he writes thirty years later.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
“I only realised it the day she said to me:
‘My mother is displeased at your remaining
so long at Versailles; go and spend some
days at your post; from thence write letters
to Vienna, in order to show where you are,
then come back.’ Such kindness, such delicacy
on her part, and still more the idea of having
to spend a fortnight without seeing her, drew
tears from my eyes; but the charming heedlessness,
which preserved her from all coquetry
prevented her noticing my emotion.</p>

<p>“As I do not believe in a passion
which cannot be reciprocated, a fortnight
was sufficient to cure me of a sentiment I
now admit for the first time, and which, for
fear of ridicule, I never should have confessed
to any one else.... Have I ever seen in
her society anything that did not bear the
impress of grace, kindliness, and good taste?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
She intuitively knew an intriguer miles off,
and hated every kind of deceit; that is why
she preferred the society of the Polignacs and
their friends—that is to say, Valentine Esterhazi,
Bésenval, Vaudreuil, Ségur, and myself.”</p>

<p>If the Prince worshipped the Queen, on
the other hand he had little esteem for the
King. He writes: “The King—in whom I
hoped to find some good qualities, whom it
may be said I have protected, whose mind I
have endeavoured to elevate by interesting
discourses, instead of his hunting topics or
idiotic conversation—cares for nothing but
tomfoolery. His practical jokes are always
aimed at Conflans, Coigny, or the Polignacs’
friends. The Queen has managed to cure
him of this habit. It was at bedtime that
his Majesty liked to worry us. He possessed,
however, a certain tact in the midst of his
rough jokes. One day, when he was threatening
us with his blue ribbon, which he tried to
throw at some one’s head, the Duc de Laval
withdrew. The King said: ‘Do not fear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Monsieur; it has nothing to do with you.’...
Coigny, the eternal fault-finder, said to
me one day: ‘Would you like to know what
these three brothers are? A fat locksmith,
the wit of a country public-house, and a
street fop.’ The two last epithets applied to
Monsieur and the Comte d’Artois.”</p>

<p>When the Prince returned to Bel Œil he
delighted his youthful daughter-in-law with
these tales; for although she liked Flanders
fairly well when not there alone with her
mother-in-law, she could not help regretting
Paris, when her husband’s duties recalled him
to the army, and her fickle father-in-law went
off on his incessant travels.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Dowager-Princess
had absolutely refused to consent to
a residence in Paris during the winter months.
She was right, for although the officers
generally returned to their respective capitals
during the bad season, the military profession
did not allow much leisure time, and Prince
Charles, being in the Austrian service, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
scarcely have been able to spend his leave in
Paris. The young Princess would therefore
have been left to the care of an aunt, who
had no authority over her, or to that of a
father-in-law, more absorbed in amusing himself
than acting as mentor to his daughter-in-law.
This delicate and dangerous position
had naturally alarmed the Princesse de Ligne,
but Hélène had not such foresight; the
pleasure she anticipated of appearing in the
brilliant society of which she had only just
caught a glimpse outweighed any feelings of
prudence, and she quite hoped to obtain her
husband’s consent in the matter.</p>

<p>The first step consisted of her presentation
at Court. Hélène had gained an ally in
her aunt the Princess, who was quite ready
to conduct her pretty niece to Versailles; but
the latter wished to make her appearance
there with all the honours of war—that is, with
those of the <i>tabouret</i>.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This could only be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
obtained by virtue of certain rights. The
rank of grandee of Spain was a sufficient
title. The Prince de Ligne possessed this
rank, and Hélène persuaded her husband to
ask the Prince to make it over to him. Such
a request was not a small affair. The young
Prince was rather embarrassed, the more so
that this request would entail another, that of
a grant of money. Magnificent costumes and
jewels, etc., had absorbed the largest part of
the young couple’s income. However, incapable
of refusing any wish of his wife’s,
Prince Charles took heart, and decided upon
writing. He immediately received from his
father, who was then at Versailles, the most
charming reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, <i>10th September 1780</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“Is it not, my dear Charles, a droll thing
to be married? You will manage to get
on, for, after all, one is bound more or less
according to circumstances. It is only fools
who do not know how to turn the position
to account: meanwhile you have a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
pretty little wife, whom without false shame
you may love. Although from father to son
we have been called Lamoral, without knowing
whether he is a saint, I am neither moral,
moralist, nor moraliser enough to preach, and
I make fun of those who do not believe in
my morality, which consists in trying to
make all around me happy. I feel quite sure
that this is your case also; without having a
whole array of principles, this is one of the
four or five I have adopted as a second
education: my first, as I told you, is, that
to be a liar or a coward would bring me with
sorrow to my grave. Certainly, my dear fellow,
you have well understood this short lesson.</p>

<p>“And now, let us come to business.
Take as much money as you require; my
men of business must have it or obtain it;
that is one subject done with.... The
Queen said she will make my affair de Kœurs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
a success, and, when I told her that my
<i>affaires de cœur</i> (love affairs) were successful,
she said <i>I was a fool</i>. Kœurs settled, that
makes two affairs done with. Your uncle, the
Bishop of Wilna, who fancies that you or I
may some day be King of Poland, wants us
to obtain the <i>indigénat</i>; we shall get it, that
is another affair terminated.</p>

<p>“Our aunt of the Tuileries wants your
wife to have the <i>tabouret</i>; she has a fancy for
going to Versailles, and for that purpose
wishes me to cede to you the <i>grandezza</i>. I
have already written to the King of Spain
and to the minister on the subject, and have
spoken of it to the ambassador. Fourth
affair concluded, leaving me the prospect of
taking cold, by being obliged to get down at
the gates of the Court, where only the coaches
of the grandees of Spain are allowed to enter,
as in the Luxembourg and elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Here are two sources of economy for
me!—the King’s play and <i>coucher</i>, which
no longer cost me anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“What annoys me is to hear clever people
say foolish things; to hear war discussed by
idlers, who have never seen anything but
military exercises, and those badly done;
disinterestedness proclaimed by women who
manage to get pensions by dint of tormenting
the ministers and the Queen, who is a
thousand times too kind; to hear sensibility
professed by those who have had at
least twenty lovers. And then, the intriguers!
the obtrusive! and the wicked!
How often this makes my blood boil, but a
quarter of an hour later I forget it all.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you a foolish saying of mine,
considered as such by all the royal family?
You know that at the town theatre I am
under the King’s box, amongst the public;
you will remember the mirror in <i>La fausse
Magie</i>.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> At the close of the play it was
dreadfully cold, and the King complained of
it, as well as of the coldness of the acting. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
said: ‘It is because the <i>dénouement</i> is <i>à la
glace</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The two brothers<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> hooted me out
loud for this pun. This existence at Versailles
is delightful; it is like life in a
country-house. I embrace your wife and
your mother for having had wit enough to
make me a Charles like yourself.</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>—By the bye, I had already
planned in my head a grove for my Charles,
a fountain that will bear the name of Hélène,
and a bower for their children.</p>

<p>“I shall work at it as soon as I leave
Versailles, to go and tell you, <i>tutti quanti</i>,
that I love you with all my heart.”</p>

Beaten by the Prussians in 1742, while commanding the Austrian
army in Bohemia, he was again defeated in Alsace in 1745. The
affability of his manners, his artistic and literary tastes, his kindness
of heart, endeared him to all, and his paternal rule is still remembered in Belgium. His generosity was boundless, and the considerable
income he received (six hundred thousand florins of Brabant)
did not suffice to cover his expenses. He ruined himself by his
prodigality, but science and art prospered under him, and schools
of paintings and colleges were established in every town. New
roads were made; trade, then at a low ebb, received a fresh
impulse; and a transport service was organised between the
Flemish ports and those of Germany and France.</p>

<p>The Prince had not spoken lightly when he
said to his son that they would go to Poland
for the <i>indigénat</i>.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In the midst of all the
pleasures and amusements of Versailles he
suddenly departed. “Family interests,” he
says, “obliged me to undertake a long journey.
My son Charles has married a pretty little
Pole, but her family has given us paper in
lieu of hard cash. Their claims were on the
Russian Court; it was necessary to go and
present them. In June 1780 I started for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Vienna, Prague, Dresden, Berlin, Saint
Petersburg, Warsaw, Cracow,—where I had
much to do,—Mogylani,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Léopol, and Brunn,—where
I was in love. I must not forget to
add that I started from Paris and the Rue de
Bourbon, from the house of the Duchesse de
Polignac, who had just been confined,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and
where I had dined with the Queen. I
promised to return at the same hour in six
months’ time, and ordered my livery coach
and courier in consequence.”</p>

<p>The sum of money the Prince de Ligne
claimed in the name of his daughter-in-law
was considerable. It amounted to four
hundred thousand roubles, which were well
worth the trouble of recovering. However,
we incline to the belief that these family
affairs were merely a cloak for political designs;
the journey was probably intended to
carry on the preliminaries of a negotiation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
begun by Joseph II. and the Empress
Catherine in their interview at Mohileff.
The Prince started from Vienna, whither
he had gone to receive his final instructions.
His companions on the journey were his son
Charles, and his friend the Chevalier de
l’Isle.</p>

<p>“I made de l’Isle a colonel,” he says, “by
simply saying when in Austria, Prussia,
Poland, and Russia that he was one, and
buying him a pair of epaulets. I was also
obliged to knight him,” he adds, “in order
to distinguish him in foreign parts from
the Abbé of the same name.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Princes started on their journey a
year after the war of the Bavarian succession
had ended. “This war entailed on
the King of Prussia a large expenditure of
men, horses, and money; it procured him
an appearance of honesty and disinterestedness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and some political amenities, but it
brought him no military honour, and caused
him to entertain very bitter feelings towards
us. Without any apparent reason the King
forbade Austrian officers to enter his dominions
without a special permit signed by him.
The Austrian Court retaliated by making the
same rule with regard to Prussian officers.
This gave rise to mutual discomfort without
reason or profit. Being of a confiding nature,
I thought I could do without a permit, but
the desire to have a letter from the great
Frederick, rather than the fear of being badly
received, induced me to write to him.”</p>

<p>Instead of one letter the Prince de Ligne
received three, all charming. For fear of
missing him the King had written from
Potsdam to Vienna, Dresden, and Berlin.
The travellers arrived at Potsdam on the
28th of June.</p>

<p>“Having to wait until twelve o’clock, at
which hour I was to be presented to the
King, together with my son Charles and M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
de l’Isle, I went to the parade ground, and
was soon surrounded and escorted by Austrian
deserters, especially those from my own regiment,
who tried to fawn upon me and ask my
forgiveness for having left me. The hour for
the presentation arrived, and the King received
me in the most charming fashion. The military
stiffness of headquarters was exchanged for
a tender and benevolent welcome. He said
he did not know I had so old a son.</p>

<p>“‘He has even been married a year, Sire.’</p>

<p>“‘May I ask to whom?’</p>

<p>“‘To a Pole—a Massalski.’</p>

<p>“‘What, a Massalski? Do you know
what her grandmother did?’</p>

<p>“‘No, Sire,’ replied Charles.</p>

<p>“‘She fired off the cannon at the siege of
Dantzic,—she fired, and made them fire, and
defended the place, when her party, who had
lost their heads, only thought of yielding.’</p>

<p>“‘Women are unaccountable creatures,’
said I, ‘strong and weak by turns, cautious and
dissimulating, they are capable of anything.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“‘No doubt,’ said M. de l’Isle, annoyed at
not having been spoken to, and he added,
with a familiarity which met with no success,
‘See, for instance——’</p>

<p>“The King interrupted him at the end of
half a second. In order to satisfy de l’Isle I
told the King that M. de Voltaire had died
in his arms; so that the King asked him a
few questions. He answered rather too
lengthily, and went away. Charles and I
remained for dinner.</p>

<p>“Every day the King had long conversations
with me, often of five hours at a time, and
completely fascinated me: fine arts, war, medicine,
literature and religion, philosophy, moral
philosophy, history and legislation, were all reviewed
in turn. The great eras of Augustus
and Louis XIV.; the refined society of the
Romans, the Greeks, and the Franks; the
chivalry of Francis the First; the frankness
and valour of Henry the Fourth; the revival
of learning; anecdotes of clever men of former
days, and their failings; Voltaire’s errors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Maupertuis’s irritability, and I know not what
else. In fact, anything and everything.
The most varied and wittiest things were
said by the King in a soft, low, and agreeable
voice, with an inexpressibly graceful
movement of the lips. The charm of his
manner was, I think, the reason why one
did not notice that, like Homer’s heroes, he
was rather a babbler, though certainly a sublime
one. His eyes, always too hard in his
portraits, although strained with work and
the fatigues of war, softened in their expression
when listening to or relating some
noble deed or trait of sensibility....</p>

<p>“One morning, as I arrived at the palace,
the King came forward and said: ‘I fear I
must be the bearer of bad news; I have just
heard that Prince Charles of Lorraine is
dying.’ He looked to see what effect the
news would have on me, and seeing the tears
fall from my eyes, he gradually and gently
changed the conversation. The next day,
the moment he saw me, the King came up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and said with an air of the deepest concern:
‘Since you must hear of the death of
a man who loved you and honoured mankind,
it is better that it should be through
some one who feels it as sincerely as
I do; poor Prince Charles is no more!’
He was deeply affected as he said these
words.”</p>

<p>After a conversation during which the
King had spoken unceasingly for nearly an
hour, the Prince, finding the part of listener
rather monotonous, seized upon an allusion
to Virgil, and said:—</p>

<p>“‘What a grand poet, Sire, but what a bad
gardener!’</p>

<p>“‘How true! Did I not try to plant,
sow, dig, and hoe, with the Georgics as
my guide? “But, Sire,” the gardener used
to say, not knowing who I was: “You are
a fool, and your book also; it is not so
that one sets to work.” Good heavens,
what a climate! would you believe it, God
and the sun refuse me everything! Look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
at my orange, olive, and lemon trees, they
are all dying of hunger.’</p>

<p>“‘Laurels, I see, are the only trees that
will grow for your Majesty.’</p>

<p>“The King gave me a delighted look,
and to cap my insipid remark with a bit of
nonsense, I quickly added: ‘And then, Sire,
there are too many grenadiers<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in this country,
they swallow up everything.’ The King
laughed, for it is only nonsense that makes
one laugh.”</p>

<p>The Prince knew that the King could
not bear M. de Ried, and that it was because
the latter had mentioned the taking
of Berlin by Marshal Haddik that the King
had conceived such a dislike for him; therefore,
when Frederick asked him if he found
Berlin much altered, he took care not to remind
him that he was one of those who took
possession of it in 1760. “He was pleased
with my reticence, for he was an old wizard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
who guessed everything, and whose tact was
the finest that ever existed.”</p>

<p>The Prince asked him a bold question
when speaking about France.</p>

<p>“There is everything, Sire, in that country,
and it really deserves to be happy; it is reported
that your Majesty had said that
if one wished to have a happy dream, one
ought——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted the King, “that is
true—one ought to be King of France.”</p>

<p>After spending a delightful fortnight at
Potsdam, the Princes took leave of the
King of Prussia with regret, and continued
their journey, arriving at Saint Petersburg in
the month of August.</p>

<p>The Empress received the Prince de
Ligne with the greatest distinction; she was
already acquainted with him through Voltaire’s
letters and the accounts the Emperor Joseph
had given her at Mohileff. Catherine found
him worthy of all the praise she had heard of
him, and writes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“We have also the Prince de Ligne, who
is one of the most amusing and easy beings
to get on with I have ever seen. Though
an original and a deep thinker, he yet has all
the gaiety of a child. His company would
suit me very well.”</p>

<p>On his part the Prince was charmed with
Catherine the Great, as he called her, and,
thanks to his account, we have a living portrait
of the Czarina.</p>

<p>“It was easy to see that she had been
handsome rather than pretty; the majesty of
her brow was softened by a pleasant look
and smile, but it showed all the force of her
character, and revealed her genius, justice,
judgment, courage, equanimity, gentleness,
calmness, and firmness.</p>

<p>“Her chin, though rather pointed, did not
exactly project; nor was it a receding chin,
but one nobly proportioned. The oval of her
face was not good, and yet it was pleasing,
for the expression of her mouth was full of
frankness and mirth. She must have had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
fresh complexion and a fine bust, which,
however, she got at the cost of her figure;
she had been almost too slight, but one
becomes very stout in Russia. She was
clean, and if her hair had not been drawn so
far back, but allowed to surround her face, she
would have been better looking. One did not
notice she was small; when she told me, in a
slow manner, that she had been very vivacious,
it seemed impossible to realise it. On entering
a drawing-room she always made the
same three bows, like a man, in the Russian
style; one to the right, one to the left, and
the other in the middle. Everything about
her was measured and methodical.”</p>

<p>The Prince had already become very
intimate with Catherine at the end of a few
days.</p>

<p>“‘What did you suppose I would be like?’
she asked me.</p>

<p>“‘I fancied your Majesty tall, stiff as a
poker, with eyes like stars, and a large hoop.
I thought also I should only have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
admire, and constant admiration is very
fatiguing.’</p>

<p>“‘Is it not true that you did not expect to
find me so stupid?’</p>

<p>“‘In truth, I thought it would be necessary
to have all one’s wits about one, that your
Majesty allowed yourself all license, and was a
perfect firework of wit; but I infinitely prefer
your careless style of conversation, which becomes
sublime when treating of noble passages
of history, or examples of sensibility or greatness.’
And the Empress heartily laughed at
this clever mingling of frankness and flattery.</p>

<p>“It was this contrast of simplicity in what
she said with the great deeds she performed
that made her interesting. A trifle
amused her; she was pleased at the smallest
joke, and cleverly turned it to account.
One day I told her that to silence the
reproaches of a lady who was displeased
with my scarcity of talk, and looking bored
in her house, I replied that I had just heard
of the death of an aunt who had brought me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
up. When the Empress was bored on the
grand reception days, she would say to me:
‘My uncle is about to die.’ Then I would
hear it murmured: ‘We are going to have a
mourning.’ And all the Court would search
up the uncle in the almanac, and of course
not find him.”</p>

<p>However great the fascination Catherine
exercised over the Prince, she did not make
him forget Marie-Thérèse, and towards the
end of his stay he wrote: “The Empress
Marie-Thérèse had certainly much greater
charm and fascination. Our Empress carried
one away: the impression made by the
Russian Empress was much weaker at first,
but gradually increased. However, they resembled
each other in this, that if the universe
had crumbled away they would have been
found <i>impavidas ferient ruinæ</i>. No power
on earth would have made them yield; their
great souls were proof against adversity;
enthusiasm preceded the one and followed
the other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>It was, however, necessary for the Prince to
tear himself away from the delights of this
charming abode. But before their departure
the Empress, laughing, said to the Prince-father:
“As you told me that you would either
sell, gamble, or lose any diamonds I should
give you, here are only a hundred roubles’
worth round my portrait on this ring!”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>To this present Catherine added jewels for
the Princesse de Ligne and her daughters;
Prince Charles received a rich casket for
Hélène, and the Princes left for Poland,
having forgotten only one thing, viz. the
claim of four hundred thousand roubles, for
which they had undertaken their journey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
“For,” says the Prince gaily, “it seemed to
me a want of delicacy to take advantage of
the favour with which I was received to
obtain favours.”</p>

<p>The Bishop of Wilna received the Prince
at his residence of Werky, a short distance
from Warsaw. “Werky,” writes the Prince,
“was a fortunate child of nature,—a large
river, three smaller ones, and a chain of
mountains, separated two valleys. Four or
five waterfalls, three islands, manufactories,
castles, a windmill, a port, a ruin, two convents
of handsome appearance, natural undulations,
temples to Vulcan, to Bacchus, and one to
Unity, which is to be erected upon piles, and a
kind of bridge at the meeting of three pretty
rivulets, an obelisk, a fisherman’s and a workman’s
hut, bridges, some ornate, others
rustic, complete the attractions of this magnificent
estate. I advise and direct everything.”</p>

<p>The Dietine (sub-Diet) of Wilna had
assembled to elect deputies for the Diet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Warsaw. The Bishop gathered round his
table eighty-four Polish gentlemen, nearly all
wearing the national costume, and having
their heads shaved after the Polish fashion.
Before dinner each of them came up to salute
the Bishop by respectfully kissing the hem of
his robe. At the end of the repast healths
were drunk; the Bishop proclaimed the name
of the person whose health was proposed;
then he filled an antique cup, beautifully
chased, emptied it and turned it over, showing
that he had drained it to the bottom. He
then passed it to his right-hand neighbour,
and in this way it went round the table.
These toasts were always celebrated with
champagne or Tokay. After an interesting
sojourn at Werky and Wilna, the Princes,
accompanied by the Bishop, started for Warsaw.
We have seen that in the negotiations
for the marriage of the Duc d’Elbœuf with
Hélène the Prince-Bishop and the Marquis
de Mirabeau had dreamt of the Polish throne
for the young Princess’s future husband. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
idea had taken possession of the Bishop’s
brain; and the accounts that were given to him
of Saint Petersburg, and the peculiarly cordial
reception that the Princes had received,
confirmed him in it. Persuaded that the
Prince was far advanced in the Empress’s
good graces, and convinced that the King
Stanislaus-Augustus was no longer in
favour, the Bishop, ever ready to throw
himself into a new adventure, took advantage
of the opening of the Diet to propose
the Marshal as candidate for the <i>indigénat</i>.</p>

<p>“You will one day be King of Poland,”
said the enthusiastic Bishop; “what a change
will come over European affairs! what good
luck for the Lignes and Massalski!” The
Marshal laughed, but, although he ridiculed
these sayings, he allowed matters to proceed.
“I had a fancy,” he says, “to please the
nation assembled for the Diet, and accordingly
presented myself.”</p>

<p>Twenty-five candidates came forward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
obtain the <i>indigénat</i>; twenty-four of them
were set aside, the Prince alone was retained;
but it required a unanimous vote, and three
opponents came forward. “They were nearly
cut down, and the violence of one of the
nuncios,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who laid his hand on his sword,
uttering very threatening words, nearly broke
up the Diet, and my too zealous partisan had
a narrow escape of losing his head.</p>

<p>“I sought my opponents; I succeeded
in overcoming their prejudices, and that so
thoroughly that they said, with a grace and
eloquence worthy of their country, that, in
favour of an acquisition they considered so
honourable, they would, each in turn, solicit
the vote of one of their friends. Against all
custom, I rushed into the nuncios’ hall, and
embraced the mustachios of these three
orators. It electrified me, for I began an
oration myself—in Latin too! then I took
them by the hand, and my advances resulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
in a general <i>sgoda</i>,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which rang three times
through the hall, nearly bringing it down, so
great were the universal acclamations.”</p>

<p>After having obtained the good graces of
the Empress Catherine, laid out the Bishop
of Wilna’s gardens, gained the <i>indigénat</i>, and
become almost as popular at Warsaw as in
Brussels, the Prince de Ligne, faithful to his
word, arrived at Versailles to the very day,
six months after having left it.</p>

<p>Hélène awaited her husband’s return with
the greatest impatience, for during his
absence and that of his father her life had
not been an easy one.</p>

<p>The Dowager-Princess generally took advantage
of her husband’s absence to reduce
the expenses of her household, and reestablish,
as much as possible, a condition
of things too often upset by the Prince,
who, like the amiable spendthrift that he
was, gaily threw millions out of the window.
Hélène would gladly have taken
her share in superintending the household;
for she had learnt at the Convent how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to keep house, and was naturally proud of
her acquirements. She gracefully proffered
her services to her mother-in-law, anxious to
display her domestic qualities, but the Princesse
de Ligne was not disposed to share
her authority with any one, and coldly refused
her daughter-in-law’s offer. Hélène, rebuffed
and humiliated, did not complain, but it left
a feeling of rancour in her mind, and from
that moment the relations between mother
and daughter-in-law became more strained.
At last the Prince’s six months’ journey drew
to a close, and it was with twofold joy that
Hélène hailed her husband’s return, and the
end of the harsh tutelage under which she
had been living.</p>

<p>The Princes found their family at
Brussels, and in the spring went to Bel Œil,
where they spent the summer together, with
the exception of Prince Louis, who was
detained by his service in Paris, and could
seldom be with them. The life at Bel
Œil was extremely gay and animated; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
stream of visitors was incessant, and poured
in from all sides—Brussels, Paris, and
even Vienna. The officers of the de Ligne
regiment came to stay in turns. Not only
did the Prince keep open house—that is to
say, that people could come and spend the
day there without any previous warning, but
there was also a certain number of apartments
kept in readiness for any unexpected guests
who might come for a longer visit. Among
the intimates at Bel Œil were the most
charming women of the Court of Brussels.</p>

<p>Although the de Lignes provided ample
entertainment and amusement for their
guests, a due part of the day was devoted
to more serious occupations. The mornings
were given up to study. Music, literature,
drawing, etc., were cultivated in turn.
“Christine pastes and unpastes, Hélène sings
and is enchanting,” wrote the Prince. As
for him, he was no sooner up than, book in
hand, he went to his island of Flora, or
worked in his library, or else inspected the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
gardens. He already possessed a private
printing-press in his house at Brussels; he
installed another at Bel Œil, which was a
source of great amusement.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Prince Charles
in particular busied himself with it, but he
confined himself to publishing the works of
others; his father, the Chevalier de l’Isle, and
the Abbé Payez, provided ample material for
the small presses of Bel Œil.</p>

<p>Prince Charles, who was an enthusiastic
admirer of pictures, had found time, in spite
of his studies and military duties, to make a
magnificent collection of original drawings,
both of ancient and modern masters.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He
was a thorough connoisseur, and drew well
himself, he even undertook to engrave
some of the drawings in his collection, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
sent for the celebrated Bartsch to give him
lessons at Bel Œil. Hélène interested herself
in her husband’s occupations, and, while
he was engraving, put the drawings in order,
studied under his guidance the different styles
of each master, and became quite an enlightened
amateur. These intellectual occupations
took up the first half of the day,
after which the family and numerous visitors
assembled for dinner. After an hour’s rest
they all went into the gardens, where they
wandered about, or indulged in reverie, or
gathered together according to taste. There
were a hundred different pastimes, and a
hundred different ways of enjoying one’s self;
the Prince had anticipated every taste and
every wish. Sometimes they went long
excursions on horseback or in carriages to
the beautiful forest of Baudour, adjoining the
woods of Bel Œil, or they sailed on the
large lake which was connected with the
canals, rivers, and smaller lakes of the park.
The boats were decked out with streamers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
and manned by small boatmen dressed in
the Prince’s livery. “During the lovely
summer evenings,” he writes, “our excursions
on the water, with music and a
bright moonlight, were most agreeable to
the ladies.”</p>

<p>The Prince never forgot them in his
rustic arrangements; well beaten-paths, so
that they might not wet their pretty feet,
bowers of roses, jasmine, orange trees, and
honeysuckle, led to the ladies’ baths. They
found shaded benches and rustic cabins,
and also “their embroidery frames, their
knitting, their netting, and, above all, their
black writing-books. Sand or something
else was often wanting, but they contained
secrets unknown both to lovers and
husbands, and, used as desks by their
owners, served to write many a pretty little
lie.”</p>

<p>At this period Brussels presented the most
brilliant and animated aspect. Prince Charles
of Lorraine had been succeeded by the Archduchess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Marie-Christine, formerly Regent of
Hungary, where she had enjoyed the privileges
of a queen. She held her court on a grand
scale, and did the honours of it with grace
and affability. The Archduchess was considered
the handsomest of Marie-Thérèse’s
four daughters. She danced so gracefully
and so lightly that, directly she began, every
one stopped to admire. Although pretending
to be annoyed, she was, on the contrary, far
from displeased at the admiration she provoked.
She had married the Archduke Albert
of Saxe-Teschen,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who was entirely under his
wife’s influence, and, unlike Prince Charles of
Lorraine, never gained the hearts of the Flemish.
Nevertheless, the Archduke’s gentle and
easy character made him beloved by all who
approached him. He was an intelligent
connoisseur in pictures, and formed two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
magnificent collections of paintings and
drawings.</p>

<p>The Archduchess and her husband took
pleasure in encouraging art and literature,
and Brussels soon became a lively literary
centre. All that appeared in France—novels,
poetry, travels, etc.—was eagerly read. Several
reviews were started. The Prince de Ligne
welcomed young Belgian authors, and helped
them in every way to the best of his
ability. Happy to avail themselves of the
lordly hospitality he so graciously offered,
they constantly came to submit to him their
essays. It is needless to say that they extolled
the beauties of Bel Œil and Baudour
in verses which were reproduced in the
gazettes of the day.</p>

<p>If Belgium had not become the scene of
political events, it is probable that the Prince
would have founded a school of literature and
good taste, for he occasionally evinced in his
writings talent of the highest order. Ideas
flowed in abundance from his fertile pen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
and he seemed merely to jot them down on
the paper at haphazard. His style, which is
capricious, incorrect, and even obscure, is
always lively and descriptive; each word
seems to fall naturally into its place under
his pen; wit abounds, unexpected, satirical,
and sometimes most daring. He has the
greatest contempt for grammar; but this very
negligence, this lordly indifference, gives to
his writings a most original style.</p>

<p>Moreover, he possessed all the requisites
of an excellent critic, but it must
be acknowledged that he was blindly indulgent
towards his own poetry. Unfortunately
gifted with deplorable facility, he never
missed an opportunity of rhyming. One evening,
when they had all gone for a long walk
in the woods, they wandered so far into the
forest that they completely lost their way,
and only found it, thanks to a star Hélène
had noticed. On the following day her
father-in-law brought her a ballad, set to
a tune then in vogue, and perhaps among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
all those he has written, it may be considered
as one of the best:—</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">À Hélène.</span></p>

</div>

<p>And so the days passed quickly and
pleasantly, the only drawback in this happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
scene being the state of Hélène’s health,
which required an amount of care her youth
and love of pleasure made it difficult for her
to take. Two accidents had successively
destroyed a hope dearly cherished by her
husband, and even more by her father-in-law,
who was anxious that his beloved
Charles should have a son. The waters of
Spa, then very much the fashion, were recommended.
Hélène went there in the
month of May 1782, accompanied by the
Chevalier de l’Isle, and her convent friend,
Mademoiselle de Conflans, who was now
Marquise de Coigny,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and on intimate terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
with the de Lignes. Hélène wrote to appoint
a meeting-place. The Chevalier de
l’Isle, who had a ready pen and familiar
style, answered as follows: “Madame de
Coigny embraces Mouchette,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and exhorts
her to wait for her to go to Spa till the
fifteenth of next month.” Hélène waited for
her, and they started together with the
Chevalier; he only remained a short time,
and on his return wrote to the Prince de
Ligne: “I did not write to you from Spa, my
dear Prince, because I hoped to see you
there, and then because I intended stopping
at Brussels, at Bel Œil even; I had begged
the Princesse Charles, who talks much better
than I can write, to speak to you of me in
her spare moments. She has none? So
much the better for both her and you, and
so much the worse for me. But I had my
turn at Spa; twenty times I was on the
point of writing, if only to tell you how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
charming your daughter-in-law was, and then
I reflected that you were not the man to
ignore it, and that when one has nothing
fresh to say, one had better hold one’s
tongue.”</p>

<p>Shortly after the Chevalier’s departure the
Prince rejoined his daughter-in-law at Spa.</p>

<p>A watering-place at that time was very
much like what it is in our days, but the
Prince describes it in the most spirited
manner: “I arrive in a large hall, where
I find the maimed showing off their arms
and their legs; ridiculous names, titles,
and faces; clerical and worldly animals
jumping and running races; hypochondriac
<i>milords</i> wandering sadly about; females
from Paris entering with roars of laughter,
to make one believe they are amiable and
at their ease, and hoping thereby to become
so; young men of all countries, counterfeiting
the English, speaking with their
teeth closed, and dressed like grooms, their
hair cut short, black, and greasy, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
pair of Jewish whiskers surrounding dirty
ears.</p>

<p>“French bishops with their nieces; an accoucheur,
decorated with the order of Saint
Michael; a dentist with that of the Spur;
dancing and singing masters in the uniform
of Russian majors; Italians in that of Polish
colonels, leading about young bears of that
country; Dutchmen scanning the papers
for the rate of exchange; thirty so-called
Knights of Malta; ribbons of all colours, to
the right and the left, at the buttonhole on
both sides, orders of all kinds, shapes, and
sizes.</p>

<p>“Old duchesses returning from their
walks armed with tall canes <i>à la Vendôme</i>,
and three coatings of white and rouge;
marchionesses, cheating doubly at cards;
horrible and suspicious faces, surrounded by
piles of ducats, and swallowing up all those
that were timidly put on the large green
cloth; two or three electors in hunting-dress,
striped with gold, armed with hunting-knives;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
a few princes incognito, who would
not produce a greater sensation under their
own names; some old generals and officers
retired on account of wounds they never
received; a few Russian princesses with their
doctors, and Palatines and Castilian ladies
with their young chaplains.</p>

<p>“Americans and burgomasters of the
neighbourhood; convicts escaped from all
the different prisons in Europe; quacks of
every description; adventurers of all kinds;
abbés of all countries. Twenty sick people
wildly dancing for their health; forty lovers,
or pretended lovers, sweating and agitating
themselves, and sixty feminine waltzers of
more or less beauty and innocence, cleverness
and coquetry, modesty and voluptuousness.
All this combined is called a dancing breakfast.”</p>

<p>After leaving the establishment of the
mineral waters, the Prince takes us to La
Sauvetière, an elegant meeting-place for
bathers: “The noise, the buzzing sound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
conversation, the uproar of the music, the
intoxicating rhythm of the waltz, the passing
and repassing of the idlers, the oaths and
sobs of the gamblers, both men and women,
the weariness of this magic-lantern made me
leave the hall. I sit down, and I see some
water drinkers religiously counting their
glasses and their steps, and congratulating
themselves, perhaps rather sadly, on the improvement
of their digestion. Some ladies
join their group.</p>

<p>“‘Do you digest the waters, Madame?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir, since yesterday.’</p>

<p>“‘Does your Excellency begin to digest?’
she says to the minister of an ecclesiastical
court.</p>

<p>“‘I have the honour to inform your
Excellency,’ he answers, ‘that I perspire from
eight o’clock in the evening till ten, and that
I sweat completely from ten till midnight. If
I had not so much business to transact for
his Grace, I should be entirely cured by the
treatment.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Hélène returned to Spa in 1783, and
met there Madame de Sabran, born a
d’Andlau,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> who became later the Marquise de
Boufflers. She was one of the most charming
women of her time, and pleased every one
who saw her by her appearance, her elegance,
and the kindliness of her nature. She was
accompanied by her little son, Elzéar de
Sabran, who little thought of the part he was
destined to play in politics later on; for the
present, he contented himself with learning
the part of Chérubin in the <i>Mariage de
Figaro</i>, the Princesse Charles studying
Suzanne, and Madame de Sabran the part of
the Countess, for after the return from Spa
the play was to be acted at Bel Œil.</p>

<p>Just at this time they received news of
the Comte d’Artois’ arrival in Flanders,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the Princes de Ligne started off at once to
receive and accompany him on his progress
through Rocroi and Spa, bringing him back
with them to Bel Œil.</p>

<p>The Princesse Hélène returned to Bel
Œil before the Princes, in order to prepare
for the Comte d’Artois’ reception; but he
had barely arrived when he fell seriously ill.
The Prince had prepared festivities which
cost him over fifty thousand francs; he never
even spoke of them to the Count, who was not
in a condition to enjoy them. Only one thing
took place, a fairy-like illumination of the
park, which the Prince, however, did not see,
for he never left the Comte d’Artois’ side,
and started with him for Versailles.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Comte d’Artois,
the Chevalier de Boufflers and Madame de
Sabran came to Bel Œil. Hearing that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Chevalier was garrisoned at Valenciennes,
the Prince wrote and proposed his joining
him at Tournai, and from there returning
with him to Bel Œil. The Chevalier replied:
“I am very much tempted, my dear Charlot,
by all you suggest; but on closely examining
your marching orders, I believe that my
regiment is the very thing I should miss.
Tell me when you go to Tournai; I intend
going there, and defying you at the head of
your army, and if I find it on two <i>Lignes</i>
(lines), I shall try to break through them.</p>

<p>“Dear Prince, I love you as if I saw you
every day of my life. After yourself there is
nothing that gives so much pleasure as the
impression that you leave. Send me your
marching orders, so that we may meet somewhere,
and that, if possible, we may part
nowhere.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p>The Chevalier arrived at Bel Œil in time
to take part in the representation of the
<i>Mariage de Figaro</i>, which was given with
great success in the pretty theatre at Bel
Œil. Hélène took the part of Suzanne;
Madame de Sabran that of the Countess;
Elzéar, Chérubin, and Boufflers, Figaro; as
for the Prince-father, he had to content
himself with the modest part of Doublemain,
the notary’s clerk; we must confess that,
though he gave others<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> good advice, he acted
very badly himself. He was generally given
the part of the notary who draws up the
marriage-contract, or that of the lackey who
brings in a letter, and would invariably come
in at the wrong moment; but on the other
hand, once on the stage he would not leave
it, but say in a supplicating whisper to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
other actors: “I am not in your way, am
I?”</p>

<p>Hélène acted with an archness and
vivacity which recalled the merry schoolgirl
of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, tempered by a little
experience; the little Elzéar was charming
as Chérubin, but the Chevalier carried off the
palm by the zest and spirit with which he
threw himself into his part. It was a curious
sight, and a sign of the times, to hear
Figaro’s soliloquy recited by a nobleman,
and applauded by the aristocratic audience
of Bel Œil.</p>

<p>Prince Charles willingly lent himself to
his wife’s amusements, though he took no
active part in them; but his serious mind
required occupations of a different order. He
took a keen interest in all scientific discoveries,
and at that moment was much
taken up with the new process of aerostation
invented by Charles Pilatre de Rozier and
Montgolfier. He witnessed the first experiments
made in Paris, and among others the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
ascension of a fire balloon, in the gardens of La
Muette, on the 21st of November 1783, made
by Pilatre de Rozier and D’Arlandes. The
aeronauts were in the greatest danger, their
balloon having caught fire; they managed to
extinguish it, and made their descent at
Gentilly in safety. At that time a balloon
ascension was looked upon as a most daring
undertaking, and no one cared to accompany
the aeronauts. But Prince Charles, whose
courage and coolness were proof against
everything, determined to take part in the
third ascent, which took place at Lyons on
the 19th of January 1784. The seven
passengers were: the elder Montgolfier,
Pilatre de Rozier, Fontaine, Prince Charles,
and three other persons who at the last
moment wished to ascend. Although the
balloon was of enormous size, the number
of passengers was too great; De Rozier had
foreseen this, and did not wish the two last
persons to enter the car. Montgolfier persuaded
him, however, to let things be; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
they were hardly off, and had only run about
five hundred fathoms, when the balloon
began imperceptibly to tear, and they were
obliged to make a hasty and perilous descent
at a distance of about a league from the town.
On their return to Lyons they were received
with acclamations by the whole population.
In April 1784 Prince Charles sent off from
the public square in front of the hôtel des
États, at Mons, a magnificent balloon, constructed
at his own expense. He had invited
the Duke and Duchess of Aremberg and a
great many distinguished personages of the
Courts of Brussels and Versailles, who, after
the ascent of the balloon, all returned to Bel
Œil.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The Prince de Ligne and his daughter-in-law
were in entire sympathy. The young
Princess enjoyed living at Bel Œil when her
father-in-law was there, but she disliked
Brussels, their winter residence. We already
know, by her own confession, that Hélène was
as “obstinate as the Pope’s mule,” and she
had not given up her purpose of settling
in Paris. Her husband disliked the idea
of the Paris life, so little in harmony with his
tastes; he had never lived in France, and, a
stranger there, he feared comparison with the
supreme elegance, the light witty tone, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
distinguished the brilliant gentlemen at the
Court of Versailles. But, as the saying goes,
“What woman wills, God wills;” Prince
Charles ended by giving way, and he bought
in September 1784 a fine mansion, situated
in the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>It is needless to say with what delight
Hélène went to live in Paris. She found most
of her old convent friends, and, presented
under the auspicies of her father-in-law, she
was welcomed and entertained on every side.</p>

<p>Received everywhere into the most brilliant
circles—at Chantilly, the Prince de Condé’s; at
Petit Bourg, the Duchesse de Bourbon’s; at
the Temple, the Prince de Conti’s—all welcomed
the young Princess, who gave herself
up entirely to a vortex of pleasure and success.
Captivated by the charm and amiability of
the young men who surrounded her with their
attentions, Hélène gave way to her natural
instinct of coquetry; she distinguished no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in particular but tried to please all; when
at home, she was occupied with her toilet
and saw very little of her husband, who but
rarely accompanied her into society, absorbed
as he was in his studies. The steady character
of the Prince, his taste for study, and
the very German and romantic turn of his
mind, formed a marked contrast with the
light, bantering, superficial tone assumed by
the courtiers. Hélène, with the giddiness of
youth, decided in her own mind that her
husband was tiresome, and had it not been
for fear of offending her father-in-law she
would not have spared him a little bantering.</p>

<p>Prince Charles’s position in Paris as husband
of a pretty and fashionable woman was
rather a trying one. With a father whose
sparkling wit made him everywhere take
a leading part in society, he was thrown
into the shade, and reduced to a secondary
position, which, however, his modesty would
not have objected to had he not felt that
it lowered him in his wife’s estimation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
When he married, it was without any feeling
of love for Hélène, whom he had hardly
seen, but he soon felt a tender and almost
paternal affection for her. He had allowed
her the greatest freedom at Bel Œil, at
the same time seeking to develop in her a
taste for serious occupations hitherto rather
checked by her intense love of pleasure. He
was beginning to succeed, but these three
winters in Paris almost annulled his efforts,
or at least greatly compromised their success.
Hélène was too young to understand and
appreciate her husband’s superior intelligence
and high character.</p>

<p>However, a long-desired event brought
the married pair nearer to each other for
a while. On the 8th of December 1786
Hélène gave birth to a little girl, who received
the name of Sidonie. This was a great joy
to Prince Charles, and he easily obtained
Hélène’s consent to go to Bel Œil in the
early spring, instead of returning to Paris.
She consented the more willingly that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
father-in-law had left Paris for the Russian
Court, whither he had been summoned by
an invitation from the Empress Catherine.</p>

<p>Before starting the Prince had had ample
time to construct the bower of roses he had
promised for Charles’s children, and as early
as the month of March a handsome Brabant
nurse, carrying a pink and white baby, might
be seen in the gardens of Bel Œil. Everything
seemed to promise a happy summer,
and in spite of the somewhat unrestricted
authority exercised over the nurse and
baby by the Dowager-Princess, which was a
source of annoyance to the young mother,
harmony and peace prevailed at Bel Œil.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, in the middle of the
summer (1787), a serious insurrection broke
out in Flanders. It had been secretly
brewing for some time past. Joseph II. had
the mania of meddling in everything; he
generally had the best intentions, but, cleverer
in theory than in practice, he often neglected
to ascertain whether a system useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
in itself might not become dangerous if applied
without any previous preparation. The
reforms he tried to introduce into Flanders
are a striking example of this sort of mistake.</p>

<p>The Flemish people, who had long been
under the dominion of Spain, were bigoted
in their religion, and as deeply attached to
their ancient political privileges as they were
to those of the Church. After the death of
Marie-Thérèse, Joseph II. began by abolishing
certain processions, pilgrimages, and a
number of confraternities. These customs
and institutions, which were certainly useless
and far too numerous, were closely interwoven
with the habits of the people, and their abolition
was a source of great offence. The
clergy were not less offended at the decree
that suppressed the Bollandists, numerous
convents and abbeys, and all the diocesan
seminaries.</p>

<p>Finally the Emperor, still animated with
the most liberal intentions, thought that “it
was his charitable duty to extend towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Protestants the effects of that civil tolerance
which, without inquiring into a man’s belief,
considers only his capacity citizen.” He
accordingly granted them a civil existence—a
privilege which till then had been refused
to them.</p>

<p>The Bishops loudly protested against
these measures, and were severely reprimanded.
Not content with attacking the
privileges of the Church, Joseph II. upset the
judicial organisation of the country, and in a
way suppressed the nationality of the Netherlands,
which were declared to be an Austrian
province, divided into nine circles, governed
by an <i>intendant</i> and Austrian commissioners,
solely dependent on the Viennese Court. This
was trampling underfoot the “<i>Joyeuse Entrée</i>”
(Joyous Entry), that grand charta of the
privileges of Brabant and the other Flemish
States.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>
<p>The irritation was at its height, for Joseph
had by his various reforms succeeded in
alienating every class of his subjects.</p>

<p>A barrister of Brussels, Van der Noot,
published an extremely violent manifesto,
demonstrating the illegality of the innovations
introduced by Joseph II. This libel was
approved of by the States,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but the author, in
danger of being arrested by the Government,
fled to England. It was at the very moment
when the revolution was being fomented that
the de Ligne family, alarmed at the agitation
going on in Belgium, hastened to join Prince
Charles at Vienna, whither he had been
summoned by Marshal Lascy. An army,
destined to fight the Turks in the ensuing
spring, was already being organised by the
Emperor’s secret orders. The Princesses de
Ligne reached Vienna at the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
summer. Hélène had made a short stay
there at the time of her marriage, and had
not retained an agreeable recollection of the
place. The Viennese manners and customs
differed too much from the French to suit
her taste. She would infinitely have preferred
spending the winter in her hotel at
Paris; but her husband’s duties detaining him
in Vienna, she dared not make the request.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Germany’s Court did not
display the brilliant aspect which might have
been expected from the most important
European power.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The simple architecture
of his palace conveyed no idea of a
sovereign’s residence. A detachment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Viennese garrison mounted guard, and a few
<i>trabans</i> posted at the inner doors superintended
the management and good order of
the interior. Joseph II.’s household was very
economically conducted. He had, however,
grand Crown officials, such as grand-master,
lord high chamberlain, grand-equerry, etc.
But they only fulfilled their duties on gala
days. In spite of the plainness and simplicity
of the Viennese Court, the personages who
composed it were of very high standing;
there were many reigning princes, brothers
of kings or electors, in the service of the
Emperor, and a crowd of great nobles, such
as the Princes de Ligne, d’Aremberg, de
Lichtenstein, Esterhazi, Colorado, Palfy,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and
others, who by their rank and future were
almost equal to their sovereign. When he
chose, the Emperor “knew how to impart
to this Court, which usually had the appearance
of a convent or a barrack, all the pomp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
and dignity worthy of the palace of Marie-Thérèse.</p>

<p>Hélène witnessed for the first time
the New Year’s festivities at Vienna. On
that day most of the Hungarian magnates<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
came to Court in their elegant costumes,
decked out with their handsomest jewels; the
Prince Esterhazi, among others, was mounted
on a richly caparisoned horse whose saddle-cloth
was studded with diamonds. The
Prince’s costume was as rich as his horse’s
trappings. “I could not look at him,”
Hélène says; “he dazzled me.” The Emperor
Joseph, so simple in private life, wore a full-dress
uniform embroidered with gold, and his
coat, his orders, and his hat glittered with
eighteen hundred thousand livres<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> worth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
diamonds; the buttons, the fastenings, the
epaulets, the braid, and the button of his hat
were one mass of diamonds. On that day the
Court servants and those of the nobility wore a
livery of silk embroidered with gold and silver.</p>

<p>The Prince de Ligne has left an interesting
portrait of Joseph II., with whom he had
been on terms of the closest intimacy. A
year before the commencement of the
Emperor’s reign, Lord Malmesbury asked
the Prince de Ligne what he thought of him.
“As a man,” replied the Prince, “he possesses
great merit and talent; as Prince he will
always be tortured by ambitions which he will
be unable to satisfy; his reign will be a sort
of perpetual and vain longing to sneeze.”</p>

<p>The Emperor Joseph was fond of the
society of amiable and distinguished women,
but no love intrigue ever arose in his intimate
circle. The Princesse Kinsky, born a Hohenzollern,
and her sister, the Princesse Clary,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
were both conspicuous at Court. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
was simple and affable, had much learning,
possessed a sound judgment, and was passionately
fond of reading and conversation. The
second, modest, gentle, and gracious, was a
better listener than her sister, and her pliant
disposition imparted great charm and ease to
her society. The Emperor had given the
Princesse Kinsky a very fine apartment in
his palace of the Haut Belvédère.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It was
there that the choicest Viennese society, both
of men and women, would meet every Thursday.
As a great favour Hélène was admitted
to this circle, and she has traced a few portraits
of these ladies—amongst others, that of
the Princesse Charles de Lichtenstein, born
Princesse d’Œttingen, who was the darling of
the Belvédère society. She was exquisitely
beautiful, and wrote marvellously well. Her
letters, nearly all written in French, overflowed
with wit; she expressed herself with
elegance; and her firm and reliable character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
her amiable and cultivated mind, so won the
heart of the Prince de Ligne that she became
his favourite sister-in-law.</p>

<p>The Comtesse Ernest de Kaunitz,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> sister
of the Princesse Charles, was plain, but witty
and lively. She would often provoke a discussion,
for she loved an argument, and
excelled in the vivacity and archness of her
repartee. The Princesse François de Lichtenstein,
born Steinberg, completed the little
circle. Second sister-in-law of the Prince de
Ligne, she pleased him less than the first; she
had an exalted idea of her rank and name, and
of the consideration that was due to her.
Serious and dignified, but at the same time
kind and benevolent, she was constantly
occupied with charitable works, and it was
difficult to escape the lottery tickets, concerts,
and collections for the poor she imposed upon
every one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>
<p>The only stranger admitted into this
society was the Duc de Braganza. The
Marshal de Lascy, the Prince de Kaunitz,
the Prince de Ligne, and several other gentlemen
of the Court frequently came, and the
Emperor Joseph never missed a Thursday at
the Belvédère.</p>

<p>In his youth Joseph II. did not give much
promise of amiability, but he changed entirely
when he became Emperor. His travels, his
campaigns, the society of distinguished women,
had formed his character and cured him of a
shyness engendered by the extreme severity
of his education.</p>

<p>The greatest freedom existed in the
Belvédère circle; the Emperor laid aside his
rank and allowed the ladies to speak with a
frankness that sometimes exceeded the
bounds of respect.</p>

<p>“The things I have heard said to Joseph
by the ladies of his society are simply inconceivable,”
writes the Prince de Ligne. “One
of them said, referring to the execution of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
robber who had been hanged by his orders
that day: ‘How could your Majesty condemn
him after your robbery of Poland?’</p>

<p>“It was at the moment of the first division
of that country.</p>

<p>“‘My mother, who enjoys all your confidence,
ladies,’ he replied, ‘and who goes to
Mass as often as you do, has long ago made
up her mind on that question. I am only her
first subject.’”</p>

<p>The Emperor was fond of receiving confidences,
and was safe and discreet, though he
was fond of meddling. His manners were
agreeable, he had some brilliancy of conversation,
a great deal of natural wit, and was a
pleasant narrator. The following is an anecdote
he was fond of repeating. When Marie-Thérèse
was so closely pursued by her enemies
that hardly a town was left to her in Germany,
not knowing where to go for her confinement,
she retired to Presburg and assembled the
States. She was young and handsome, with a
dazzling complexion, and appeared before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Hungarian <i>paladins</i> clad in a long mourning
garment, which set off the radiancy of her
beauty; her son, two or three years of age, was
clasped in her arms. “I confide him to you,”
she said, presenting the child, who began to cry.
The Emperor, in telling this story, always
added that his mother, who knew the way to
produce an effect, gave him a sly pinch as she
presented him to the Hungarians; touched by
the cries of the child, who seemed to implore
their compassion, “my bearded heroes drew
their swords, and swore on their Turkish
blades to defend both mother and son to the
last drop of their blood.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The little group that met at the Belvédère
did not represent the only society in
Vienna; many other houses threw open their
doors. The Princesse Lubomirska,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
called the Princesse Maréchale, held
some of the most brilliant receptions. Her
original and ready wit, and the piquancy of
her manner, imparted a certain liveliness to
the character of her “salon.” She forebade
all talk of war or politics at her house. “No
politics,” she said, “in the drawing-room,
where the men are more women than we
are.”</p>

<p>A great many balls were given in Vienna,
and they were always very animated, for the
Viennese were passionately fond of dancing.
They waltzed so furiously and with such
rapidity that at first Hélène, though a beautiful
dancer, was made quite giddy by the
pace. She, however, soon became accustomed,
like others, never to rest for a moment
as long as the waltz lasted.</p>

<p>The balls of the Princesse Lubomirska were
delightful; they always began and ended with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
a polonaise, a kind of measured march, interrupted
at intervals by a graceful <i>balancé</i> or
swinging movement. “When the elderly
people wish to join in the dance they ask for
a polonaise,” says the Prince de Ligne, “and
then the good people perform the figures,
and move round with a contented smile on
their faces, as they recollect the good old
times, and the way they used to smile. The
young people are entirely taken up with the
present, of which they do not care to lose a
moment.” This dance displayed to advantage
the elegance and grace of the figure.
Hélène excelled in it, and took a patriotic
pride in carrying off the palm.</p>

<p>The Princesse Charles was passionately
fond of music, and had a box at the Court
theatre. <i>Don Juan</i> had just been given with
great success at Prague, in honour of the
visit of the Duchess of Tuscany, the wife of
Leopold. Mozart had in person directed the
rehearsals. The Emperor Joseph, about to
leave for the army, pressed Mozart to return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
to Vienna to get up the opera there at once.
The rehearsals were rapidly got through, and
the representation was given before a large
audience. Hélène was present, and all the
Viennese nobility witnessed the performance.
<i>Don Juan</i> was admirably sung, but the public,
with few exceptions, of which Hélène was
one, remained cold throughout. The Emperor,
who thought the music admirable, was
vexed at the indifference of the audience.</p>

<p>“It is a divine work,” he said to Mozart,
whom he had summoned to his box, “but it is
not the sort of thing for my Viennese!”</p>

<p>“We must give them time to appreciate
it,” modestly replied the author. “It suited the
Prague people better; but I composed it only
for myself and my friends.”</p>

<p>On leaving the theatre some of the
spectators went to the house of the Comtesse
de Thun, and they were warmly discussing
the new work when Haydn entered. Every
one was of a different opinion, and though admitting
for the most part that the music bore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the impress of genius, all declared that in
some parts it was obscure and incomprehensible.
Haydn was chosen as judge. “I am
not in a position to decide in such a learned
dispute,” said he with malicious humility;
“all I know is that Mozart is the greatest
musician living.”</p>

<p>The concerts at Vienna were numerous
and most magnificent. The Emperor had a
passion for instrumental music. Mozart and
Haydn’s<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> symphonies were played with rare
perfection by an excellent orchestra, led by
Salieri.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It was likewise in the spring of
1787 that the <i>Seven Words</i> were given for
the first time—an oratorio which is looked
upon as Haydn’s masterpiece.</p>

<p>It is evident that Hélène might have spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
a most agreeable winter in Vienna, but she
did not like Viennese society. A Parisian
at heart, she felt there entirely out of her
element. Her husband, on the other hand,
who had known all the families about Court
from childhood, was infinitely more at home
in Vienna than in Paris. He was on the most
intimate terms with all the young married
women who were friends of his sisters. One
of them in particular treated him with the
affectionate familiarity of an old playfellow;
this was the Comtesse Kinsky, born a
Dietrichstein, and daughter-in-law to the
Princess presiding at the Belvédère. It
would have been difficult to meet with a
more fascinating woman, and her romantic
story added greatly to her charm. Comte
Kinsky’s parents and her own had agreed on
a marriage between their children without
consulting them on the subject. The young
Count was garrisoned in a small Hungarian
town, and only arrived in time for the
marriage ceremony. Immediately afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
he conducted his young wife home, kissed
her hand, and said: “Madame, we have
obeyed our parents; and I must confess it is
with regret that I leave you; but my affections
have long been engaged to a woman
without whom I cannot live, and to whom I
must now return.” A post-chaise was at the
door of the church; the Count drove off and
never returned. Comtesse Kinsky was therefore
neither maid, wife, nor widow, and the
dangers of this peculiar position were enhanced
by her extreme beauty, which it
would have been difficult to outrival. She
united to her external charms a cultivated
mind and an excellent heart. Hélène often
met her at the Comtesse de Thun’s, who was
an intimate friend of the de Lignes, and
whose house was their habitual rendezvous.</p>

<p>Comte François de Dietrichstein,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
de Kinsky’s brother, was a great friend of
Prince Charles, with whom he had been
brought up. The peculiar position of the
Countess rendered this intimacy very hazardous,
and Prince Charles’s tender affection for
her partook very much of the nature of love.
With a woman’s quick instinct, Hélène
divined between her husband and the beautiful
Countess a secret tie, the nature of which
she could not make out, the strictest propriety
being observed on both sides. We must admit
that, in spite of little Sidonie’s birth, which
for a moment drew the pair more closely together,
they were becoming very indifferent
towards each other. The Prince had not
forgotten the contemptuous manner with
which his wife had treated him in Paris, and
he was not sorry to show her that in Vienna
he played quite a different part. In short,
neither one nor the other had made a love
match. Social conventions and a similarity
of tastes had conduced to a certain degree of
friendship; but would that suffice to guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
either against any warmer sentiment that
might intervene?</p>

<p>And so the winter passed. The revolution
in Flanders had assumed alarming proportions,
and there could be no question of
returning to Bel Œil. Prince Charles, who
had rejoined his regiment, served under
General de Lascy’s orders, and had left
Vienna for some time. No sooner had he
taken his departure than Hélène wrote to
ask his permission to join her uncle at Warsaw,
where the Diet was about to meet.
Some important business with the Prince-Bishop
served as a pretext for the journey.
The authorisation was easily granted, on condition
that she should leave little Sidonie
under the care of her grandmother; and
Hélène left Vienna in September 1788.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the year 1786 the Prince
de Ligne received an invitation from the
Czarina, asking him to join her at St. Petersburg,
and accompany her in a journey she
was about to undertake in the Crimea. This
invitation was secretly intended to prepare an
interview that was to take place at Kherson
between Catherine and Joseph II. Turkey had
ceded the Crimea and Kouban to Russia in
January 1784. These acquisitions had only
aggravated Catherine’s thirst for further conquest.
She already betrayed her ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
in the smallest details: one of her grandsons
had been named Alexander, and the other
Constantine; the Crimea was now again
called Tauris; but her ambitious designs did
not end there. The Empress received the
Prince de Ligne as if he had only left her
the day before, informed him of her plans,
and at the end of December sent him back
to Joseph with the itinerary of her journey
and the result of his secret mission.</p>

<p>Under the pretext of visiting her new dominions
the Czarina undertook on the 15th of
January 1787 a journey through the southern
provinces of her empire. She was accompanied
by her favourite, Count Momonoff, and
by the ambassadors of France, Austria, and
England, and by the Prince de Ligne, who
met her at Kief. “I occupied,” he says, “the
position of a diplomatic jockey.”</p>

<p>She was also accompanied by a considerable
number of princes and Russian lords.
Her flotilla consisted of eighty-four ships,
manned by three thousand seamen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>The King, Stanislaus-Augustus, awaited
the Czarina at Kanew. She slowly descended
the Borysthenes in a galley as magnificent as
that of Cleopatra. The Prince de Ligne left
the flotilla in a small Zaporavian canoe to
announce Catherine’s arrival to the King. An
hour later the great lords of the empire came
to fetch him in a gunboat brilliantly decorated.
Whilst stepping on board he said, with the
inexpressible charm of manner and pleasant
tone of voice so peculiar to him: “Gentlemen,
the King of Poland has requested me to
commend to you Comte Poniatowski.” The
dinner was very gay, and while the King’s
health was drunk, three salutes were fired by
the artillery of the whole fleet. Afterwards
the King gave a supper to all the nobles of
his retinue. The fleet had cast anchor before
the palace improvised for him; no sooner
had night closed in than a general conflagration
on the neighbouring shores of the Borysthenes
simulated an eruption of Vesuvius,
lighting up the valleys, the mountains, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the river in a most glorious manner. The
glare of the fires lit up the fantastic display
of the brilliant squadrons of Polish
cavalry. Stanislaus had spent three months
and three millions in order to see the Czarina
for three hours. She had loved him, but,
long ago, this love had been replaced by
others; and now she slowly and cruelly tore
from him the shreds of the kingdom she had
formerly bestowed. They separated with all
the appearance of friendliness, but during
their short meeting the King had had time
to perceive that there was no hope of reviving
the past.</p>

<p>This was the last interview that took place
between Catherine and Stanislaus. Eight
years later she dethroned him with her own
hands.</p>

<p>The Emperor Joseph met the Czarina at
Kherson, and they continued together on
their travels, which resembled those of a
fairy tale. “I still fancy I am dreaming,”
says the Prince de Ligne, “when I recall that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
journey, in an enormous coach large enough
for six people, quite a triumphal chariot in
fact, studded all over with precious stones,
and drawn by sixteen horses of the Tartar
race. How, as I sat between two persons, on
whose shoulders I would sink at times, overcome
by the heat, I would be startled by
such snatches of conversation as these:—</p>

<p>“‘I have thirty millions of subjects, I am
told, counting only the males.’</p>

<p>“‘And I, twenty-two,’ replied the other,
‘counting all.’</p>

<p>“They made imaginary conquests of towns
and provinces, as if that were nothing at all,
whilst I kept on saying: ‘Your Majesties will
reap nothing but worry and misery,’ to which
the Emperor would reply, addressing himself
to the Empress: ‘Madame, we treat him
too well; he has no respect for us. Did you
know, Madame, that he had been in love with
one of my father’s mistresses, and at the time
of my first successes in society he outwitted
me in the affections of a marchioness who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
was an object of adoration to both of us, and
as beautiful as an angel?’”</p>

<p>During the journey the Empress had made
a gift of the site of Iphigenia’s rock to the
Prince de Ligne. All those who possessed
land in the Crimea, such as the Mourzas, took
the oath of fidelity to Catherine, and the
Prince de Ligne followed suit. The Emperor
came up to him, and taking hold of his order
of the Golden Fleece, said: “You are the
first one of this order who has sworn allegiance
together with the long-bearded
lords.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” said de Ligne, with a malicious
air, “it is better both for your Majesty and
myself that I should take it with the Tartar
lords than with those of Flanders.”</p>

<p>The Emperor had just heard of the
rebellion in that country, of which we shall
speak later on.</p>

<p>After their return from this fairy-like journey
the war against the Turks was decided,
and the Austro-Russian alliance concluded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Preparations for war were being quietly
carried on when, all at once, Turkey assumed
the offensive by arresting the Russian
ambassador, M. de Bulgakoff, and confining
him in the Castle of the Sept Tours (Seven
Towers). On the 18th of August 1787
Catherine declared war.</p>

<p>The Empress thoroughly relied on the
alliance she had just concluded with Joseph
II.; nevertheless she inquired of the Prince
de Ligne:—</p>

<p>“What do you think the Emperor will do?”</p>

<p>“Have you any doubt, Madame? He will
convey to you his good intentions, perhaps
even his best wishes; and as neither will cost
him anything, I am sure his first letter will
be full of them.”</p>

<p>The Prince was mistaken; the Emperor
was ready to appear on the field with a
hundred thousand men,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and had just appointed
the Prince General-Commander-in-chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
(feldzeugmeister) of all the infantry.
Unfortunately the letter bringing this news
crossed one the Prince had written to the
Emperor asking his permission to serve as
a general in the Russian army, and at the
same time offering to keep His Majesty
well informed of the Russian plans of campaign
and military operations. The Emperor
granted this request.</p>

<p>The Prince began preparing for his departure
in October 1787. “I received,” he
says, “from the Emperor a letter concerning
his ally that showed both his kindness
and genius; I made a summary of it that
served as a plan of campaign, for none had
as yet been conceived at Saint Petersburg.
They had no idea by what end to begin.”</p>

<p>Before starting to join Potemkin<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Prince wished to give a ball to the prettiest
women at Court, according to their request,
but was unable to do so, as the war operations
were already far advanced. “The army,” he
was told, “may perhaps be already under
the walls of Oczakoff; five thousand Turks
have been killed by Souvaroff at Kinburn.
The Turkish fleet is retiring; start at once.”</p>

<p>He left on the 1st of November 1787.
“Good heavens!” he writes, “what weather!
what roads! what a winter! what headquarters!
By nature I am confiding, and
always believe I am loved. I thought the
Prince, judging by his own words, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
be delighted to see me. I only observed six
months later the embarrassed manner in which
he received me on the day of my arrival. I
threw myself into his arms and said:—</p>

<p>“‘When shall we take Oczakoff?’</p>

<p>“‘Who knows!’ he said; ‘the garrison
numbers eighteen thousand men; I have
not as many in the whole of my army. I
am short of everything, and the most unhappy
of mortals, unless God helps me.’</p>

<p>“‘What!’ I replied, ‘the story of Kinburn,
the departure of the fleet, has all that been of
no use? I have travelled day and night, for
they told me you had already begun the
siege!’</p>

<p>“‘Alas,’ he answered, ‘God grant that the
Tartars do not get here, and lay waste the
whole country with fire and sword. God has
saved me (I shall never forget it). He
allowed me to collect behind the banks of
the Bog what remained of the troops. It is
a miracle that I have retained till now as
much of the country as I have.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“‘Where are the Tartars?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Everywhere,’ he replied, ‘and among
them is a séraskier,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> with a large number of
Turks, near Ackermann, twelve thousand
men in Bender, the Dniester is guarded, and
there are six thousand men in Choczim.’”</p>

<p>There was not a word of truth in all
this. Five months were spent in a state of
inactivity which would have been inexplicable
had it not been intentional. The Prince de
Ligne was not long in perceiving that this
was the case, and punctually warned the
Emperor of Austria.</p>

<p>During the long days of <i>far niente</i> the
Prince amused himself by scribbling down
his thoughts on little squares of paper, which,
though he appeared to attach no importance
to them, he took care to preserve. They
were well worth keeping, to judge by the
following:—</p>

<p>“Europe is in such a perfect mess at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
present moment that I think it a good time
to reflect on the position of affairs. France
writes, but, unfortunately, the Empire reads.
The soldiers of the Bishop of Liege are
at open war with the bankers of Spa.
The Netherlands have risen against their
sovereign without knowing why. Soon, no
doubt, people will kill one another in the
hope of gaining more freedom and happiness.
Austria, exposed to dangers at home, timidly
threatens both friend and foe, and is unable
to distinguish one from the other. England,
who is never entirely of the same opinion,
has a majority in favour of Prussia, who has
already fired a few shots in Holland! Proud
Spain, who formerly owned the invincible
fleet, gets anxious as soon as a single
English vessel leaves port. Italy fears the
lazzaroni and the free-thinkers. Denmark
watches Sweden, and Sweden watches
Russia. The Tartars, the Georgians, the
Imarets, the Abyssinians, the Circassians, kill
the Russians. The journey to the Crimea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
alarms and irritates the Sultan. The Egyptian
and Scutari bashaws are warring with the
Turks, who, from two other sides, at a
thousand leagues’ distance, are at the same
time attacking the two most powerful and
important empires that exist. We are called
to arms, and I join the fray. Without ceasing
to be a spectator, I become an actor in the
play. In my opinion all that is taking place
around me is nothing more than a kick in
an anthill. Are we anything better ourselves,
poor mortals that we are?”</p>

<p>During this time the corps under Marshal
Lascy<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> had opened the campaign; the
Emperor commanded in person, and Prince
Charles, who had not accompanied his
father to Russia, served as major in the
engineers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>
<p>The Prince soon distinguished himself at
the siege of Sabacz, where he superintended
the opening of the trenches, and directed the
batteries which attacked the fort.</p>

<p>On the day of the assault, by means of
a plank, he crossed the wide deep moats
which protected the approaches of the fortress;
he was the first to dash forward and
scale the wall, and once on the top of the
ramparts, in spite of the efforts of the Turks,
he held out his hand to the soldiers who had
followed him, helped them up, and was the
first to enter the town. The Emperor, who
witnessed this brilliant exploit, conferred on
the Prince the rank of Colonel, and decorated
him with the order of Marie-Thérèse,
without holding a chapter of the order—an
honour which was entirely without precedent.
It so happened that the garrison of Belgrade
was carrying on such a heavy cannonading
during the ceremony that the Emperor
Joseph, addressing the Prince, said: “Even
the Turks are taking part in your initiation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
and celebrating your valour and my
justice.”</p>

<p>The Emperor himself announced to the
Prince de Ligne his son’s brilliant conduct:
the pride and emotion of the father can only
be described in his own words. He writes
to the Comte de Ségur:—</p>

<p class="right">
<i>8th May 1788.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“Ah! my friend, let me weep awhile; and
read the following!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“‘<span class="smcap">The Emperor Joseph to the Prince de Ligne.</span></p>
<p class="right">
“‘<span class="smcap">Kilenack</span>, <i>25th April 1788</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“‘We have just taken Sabacz:<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> our loss
was small. The feldzeugmeister, Rouvroy,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
a brave man, as you know, received a slight
wound in the chest, which does not prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
him from dressing himself or going out.
Prince Poniatowski was shot in the thigh,
and though the bone is not injured the wound
is somewhat serious. But I must, my dear
Prince, inform you of something else, which
will please you all the more that in it you
will recognise the spirit of your race; it is
that your son Charles contributed for the
most part to the success of this enterprise,
by the infinite pains that he took in marking
out the trenches for the batteries, and he was
<i>the first</i> to scale the parapet and help up the
rest. So I have named him Lieutenant-Colonel,
and have conferred on him the
order of Marie-Thérèse. It is a real pleasure
to me to send you this intelligence, as
I am aware of the satisfaction it will give
you, knowing, as I do, your patriotism and
your affection for your son.</p>

<p>“‘I leave to-morrow for Semlin.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘<span class="smcap">Joseph.</span>’<br>
</p>

<p>“What modesty! The Emperor does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
mention himself, though he was in the midst
of the firing. And how graciously and
kindly expressed is the account he sends
me. On reading it over again I burst into
tears.”</p>

<p class="right">
<i>8th May (continued from the above).</i><br>
</p>

<p>“The messenger saw the Emperor himself
firing musket shots with hearty goodwill
into the suburbs of Sabacz; and Marshal
de Lascy tear up some palings to point a
cannon, which should protect my Charles by
attacking a turret from which a continual
fire was being directed against him. The
Marshal would, I believe, have done it for
any other, but it had the appearance of personal
and almost paternal kindness.</p>

<p>“The Marshal being rather exhausted, the
Emperor fetched a barrel and made him sit
down, while he himself stood surrounded by
his generals, thus paying him a kind of
homage.</p>

<p>“Here is a letter from Charles himself:—</p>

<p>“‘We have taken Sabacz. I have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
cross. You may be sure, papa, that I
thought of you on going up the first to the
assault.—Your submissive and respectful son,</p>

<p class="right">
“‘<span class="smcap">Charles</span>.’<br>
</p>

<p>“Could there be anything more touching!
Would I had been there to give him a hand!
I can see that I have his esteem by the words,
<i>I thought of you</i>, but I should have deserved
it still better. I feel too much affected to
write more. I embrace you, my dear Count.”</p>
</div>

<p>But it is with his son that the Prince
gives himself up to all the intensity of his
feelings.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">From Potemkin’s Headquarters at
Elisabethgorod.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>12th May 1788.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“What can I tell you, my dear Charles,
that you do not already know of my feelings
on receiving from His Majesty a letter so full
of kindness and graciousness? This letter
is worth more to you than any parchments
containing titles, diplomas, or patents—mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
food for rats. It contains such touching words
for us both that, though I am getting rather
old to cry, it is impossible for me to refrain
from doing so whenever I read over that
paragraph. All the Circassian generals and
officers, the Zaporogues, Tartars, Cabardians,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Germans, Russians, Cossacks, etc.,—all came
to me in crowds, to congratulate me with
a warmth I can never forget.</p>

<p>“The father and most tender friend of my
Charles are assuredly deeply touched at the
honour you have won, and which surpasses
anything I have ever done in my life. But
the General de Ligne has suffered abominably.</p>

<p>“Imagine, my boy, what a delightful
moment for both of us had I been the first
to accept your aid in clambering up that parapet,
where you arrived before any one else!</p>

<p>“Good heavens, what a fool one is at a
distance! I, who at Hühnerwasser would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
have calmly seen you shot through the arm—I
am as nervous as any woman,—a condition
which is not far removed from that of
minister.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> However, I have agreed with
some regiments of light horse to make a
good slashing charge. I have never done
anything of the kind, except at the head of
ten Uhlans against five or six drunken
Prussian hussars. You will admit that it
was not the most memorable action of this
century. I cannot shut myself up in those
squares, as in a box, where one opens a door
to come in or go out.</p>

<p>“One can always manage to command if
one chooses on the day of battle, so that I am
perfectly certain, though I have not an army,
that nothing will happen where I am but what
I choose; I have already learnt all that is
necessary, and am beginning to understand
Russian. Do you think now, my Charles,
that I was right in always wishing you to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
an engineer? You have now shown genius,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
as I knew you would. But are you sure you
are not slightly wounded, though you do not
say so?</p>

<p>“Do not let any of His Majesty’s messengers
come to me without sending me a
letter. A thousand messages to my comrade
Rouvroy, whose fate and wound I envy.
Poor Poniatowski!<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> I tremble lest he should
follow in his father’s footsteps. He has
already the same courage, the same military
intelligence, personal devotion to His Majesty,
generosity, etc., but I trust he will not have
the same fate. Embrace him for me.”</p>
</div>

<p>The news of the taking of Sabacz had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
made a welcome break in the weary existence
the Prince’s father was leading; but Potemkin’s
apathy made him relapse into bad
humour and impatience. He tried in vain to
sting his pride by making constant allusions
to the storming of Sabacz, but he had rightly
guessed “that, either out of policy, ill-will,
or incapacity, the marshals were resolved,
even before the campaign was begun, on
doing nothing.”</p>

<p>At last, wearied by this determined
inaction, he wrote to Prince Potemkin that
he should leave the next day for Marshal
Romanzoff’s<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> camp in Ukrania.</p>

<p>“At last,” writes the Prince, “I have left
those filthy entrenchments which, in virtue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of a few projecting angles, are supposed to
represent a fort; eight days more and I
should have died of it. Potemkin nearly
drove me mad. Sometimes on good terms,
sometimes on bad, at daggers drawn or prime
favourite, speaking or not speaking, but sitting
up sometimes till six in the morning to
induce him at least to say one word sensible
enough to report,—I could no longer endure
the whims of such a spoilt child.”</p>

<p>Wearied to death by this horrible inaction,
the Prince went to see why Marshal Romanzoff
was no better employed than Potemkin.</p>

<p>Romanzoff, as amiable as Potemkin was
the reverse, loaded the Prince with promises
and attentions, all equally, false. At the
end of a few days Ligne was fully convinced
that the two Commanders-in-Chief of the
Russian army were agreed on one point—“to
play a trick on the Emperor Joseph,
and only begin the campaign in July, by
which time the whole of the Turkish forces
would have been directed against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Austrians.” The Prince de Ligne redoubled
his efforts to stir up Potemkin. He wrote to
the Austrian ambassador at St. Petersburg, and
to the Comte de Ségur, urging them to inform
the Empress of the situation; but though
himself in such favour at Court he never
once wrote to Catherine. She knew the
motive of his silence, and was irritated at it;
but she would not complain, in case that, in a
fit of frankness, the Prince should say too
much. “If I had chosen,” he says, “to write
only once in praise of Prince Potemkin and
his operations,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> I should have received
showers of presents in diamonds and serfs.
Catherine would have been very well pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
if I had deceived her; it would have been
more convenient for her to believe that all
was going on well.”</p>

<p>In spite of his anger against the Russian
Marshals the Prince de Ligne, who was a
connoisseur, sincerely admired the Muscovite
nation and soldiery.</p>

<p>“I see that the Russians,” he writes to
the Comte de Ségur, “learn the liberal arts
in the same way that <i>le médecin malgré lui</i>
(the doctor in spite of himself) took his
degree. They are foot-soldiers, sailors, sportsmen,
priests, dragoons, musicians, engineers,
actors, cuirassiers, painters and surgeons.
I see the Russians sing and dance in the
trenches, though they are never relieved,
and remain in the midst of shot and shell,
of snow or mud, clever, clean, attentive,
respectful, obedient, trying to forestall their
orders by divining them in the eyes of their
officers.”</p>

<p>The greatest pleasure the General de
Ligne had was to write and receive news of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
absent friends. His letters are so wonderfully
graphic, the slightest detail is invested with
so much charm, that one is never tired of
reading them. Those he wrote to his son
Charles are a perfect diary of his life.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">From Marshal Romanzoff’s Headquarters
in Poland.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>8th June 1788.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“If you inquire, my dear Charles, how I
am, I shall reply: Always the same. I am
continually with the armies and the marshals,
trying to make them do something. But the
devil is with them, in spite of all their
Russian signs of the cross.</p>

<p>“The best thing I have done is to have
left that quiz, that maker of compliments, my
admirer, as he calls himself, for Kaminiecz.
Ah! if I still had a heart, how terribly in
love I should be! The governor’s wife,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
magnificent Greek, known and admired all
over the world, drove me in a berlin within
half a cannon’s range of Choczim, from whence
a few shots were fired over our heads.</p>

<p>“I confess that I felt more inclined to find
out her weak point of attack than to
reconnoitre that of the fortress.</p>

<p>“I stay at her house; but what an infernal
row goes on! A rattle of chains all night;
I thought there were ghosts. The fact is
that her husband, who is commandant of
Kaminiecz, has all his work done by convicts.
What a contrast between their rascally
countenances and the beauty of her whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
they serve, under the sway of the rod! Even
the cook is a convict; it is economical, but
dreadful.</p>

<p>“I wish, my dear Charles, that Oczakoff
(I must return to Potemkin, for I am still more
incapable of moving this man) may procure
me something glorious in your style. I shall
be killed on your account, for you must have
a father worthy of you. <i>You thought of me</i>,
you say; you are sublime and touching. You
have worked for me; I will work for you. I
send you a tender farewell from these five or
six hundred leagues distance.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince found Potemkin and his army
just as he had left them, and he writes to his
son, who had recommended a Prussian officer
to him:——</p>


<p><span class="smcap">From the Camp in the Deserts of Tartary.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
Before <span class="smcap">Oczakoff</span>, <i>30th July</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“I will place your Prussian officer. I
cannot make Prince Potemkin advance as far
as the Liman, but I can advance officers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
I have made generals, majors, etc.; but you
have made your crop of laurels, and can
laugh at me.</p>

<p>“Always the same inaction, one-third
through fear, one through spite, and one
through ignorance. I would wish, at the end
of the war, to have one-quarter of your glory
in this campaign. Your letters are gay and
brave, like yourself; they bear your image.</p>

<p>“A fearful storm obliges me to go to bed.
A cloud has burst over the camp, and inundated
the two pretty little houses I have
erected under my immense Turkish tent, so
that I do not know where to put my foot.
Oh, oh! I am this moment informed that a
major has been killed by lightning in his
tent; it falls nearly every day, catch it who
may.</p>

<p>“The other day the arms of an officer of
light cavalry had to be amputated on account
of the bite of a tarentula; as for lizards, no
one is in a better position than I am to assert
that they are the friend of man; for I live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
with them, and can trust them better than my
friends in this country. Sometimes I hear
the wind rising, and have my tent opened,
but I shut it up again quickly; for the wind
seems to blow off a furnace. Oh! we do enjoy
every sort of advantage here. Shall I give
you a specimen of Prince Repnin’s good taste?
You know the habits of the service here, the
baseness of the inferiors, and the insolence
of the superiors. When Prince Potemkin
makes a sign or drops anything, twenty
generals prostrate themselves to earth. The
other day seven or eight of them tried to
help Prince Repnin off with his cloak: ‘No,
gentlemen,’ he said; ‘the Prince de Ligne will
kindly do it.’ A good lesson! They have
more refinement of mind than of heart, and
they felt it.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I rather play the victim;
but Sarti<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is here with an excellent orchestra,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
and he has brought that music you know so
well, in which there are thirty C’s, thirty D’s,
etc. Sometimes we have no bread, only
biscuits and macaroons; no apples or pears,
but pots of jam; no butter, but ices; no
water, but every kind of wine; no wood for
the kitchen fire sometimes, but logs of aloës
to burn for perfume. We have here Madame
Michel Potemkin, who is extremely beautiful;
Madame Skawrowski, another niece
of the vizier or patriarch Potemkin (for he
arranges his religion also), very charming;
and Madame Samoiloff, another niece, still
more lovely. I played a proverb for her
in this desert, and she seemed to like it, for
she has since said: ‘Do play another <i>riddle</i>
for me.’</p>

<p>“I presented the other day to the Prince a
blockhead sent to me by a fool. One is
called Marolles, the other is M. de X——,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
who recommends him as head of the engineers,
and destined to take Oczakoff.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning, General,’ he said, on
entering, to the Prince, ‘I will take that
place for you in a fortnight. Have you any
books here? Do you know in Russia those
of a M. Vauban and a certain Coëhorn?<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> I
should like to look them over before beginning.’
You may fancy Potemkin’s astonishment.
‘What a man!’ he said to me,
‘I do not know if he is an engineer, but I
know he is French. Ask him a few questions.’
I did so, and he admitted he was an
engineer for roads and bridges.</p>

<p>“Baron de Stad, who is here, delights me.
He also is a thorough Frenchman; annoying
the Prince, unpleasant to every one, writing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
charming verses, hating the petulance of
Roger,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> with whom he is perpetually quarrelling,
and going gallantly into action, though
declaring all the time that he is dying of
fright. ‘Behold,’ says he, ‘how nature suffers;
my horse himself trembles, and cares no more
for glory than I do.’ We have seen another
personage, as ridiculous as his name, which
is Gigandé, a lieutenant in the guards of the
Abbé de Porentruy. Yesterday he was robbed.
Furious, he exclaimed, with his Swiss accent:
‘<i>Che me lèfe, che m’égorge les pieds pour
aller tout te suite faire mes blaintes à un
chéneral et il me tit: ‘Si c’est un soltat, che<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
vous ferai rentre, mais, si c’est un officier,
cela sera tifficile.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>“Another Frenchman, whose name is M.
Second, came to consult me about an affair of
honour. ‘For I see, sir,’ he said, ‘that I shall
be forced to fight!’ I assured him that if
he spoke in that way to everybody he would
have no need of a man of his own name; that
was a good piece of nonsense, was it not?</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you one of my innocent
amusements? I place my dromedaries in
the way of the gilded staff, when by chance
‘<i>Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre</i>’ (Marlborough
goes off to the wars).<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The other day two or
three generals were thrown, half the escort
upset, and the other half sent flying.</p>

<p>“Ah, Charles, when shall we meet again,
at Stamboul or at Bel Œil? If only the
Emperor and my Russian General would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
stand on such ceremony about crossing the
Save and the Bog as they would do to go
through a door, we should soon upset the
<i>Sublime Porte</i>, and should meet where I said.
<i>Then, my dear Cinéas</i>, etc., etc. In the meanwhile
let us love each other wherever we are.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the Russian side the situation remained
the same till October, and during this
time things went as badly as possible for
Austria. This disastrous campaign cost her
thirty thousand men, killed in various engagements,
forty thousand carried off by the
plague, the invasion of the Banate, and several
defeats in Bosnia. Ill with fatigue, in
despair at his want of success, alarmed at
the complete rebellion in Flanders, Joseph
returned to Vienna almost broken-hearted.
He determined to call to his side the Prince
de Ligne, and to give him, with Marshal
Laudon, the command of his army during the
ensuing campaign. He sent Prince Charles
to carry the order to his father. We can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
imagine how welcome was the arrival of the
conqueror of Sabacz, and with what transports
of delight he was received. His father
immediately prepared to depart, and they
arrived in Vienna at the end of November.
Potemkin took Oczakoff a fortnight later.
It seemed as though he had waited Ligne’s
departure before deciding on the attack, and
his jealous character justifies the supposition.
The winter was peacefully spent at Vienna, and
Prince Charles, absorbed in his new passion,
did not seem afflicted at his wife’s absence.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1789 the two Princes
joined Marshal Laudon’s army. General de
Ligne commanded the right wing, and played
an important part at the siege of Belgrade,
during which he displayed an indefatigable
energy. “I was all on fire myself,” he writes,
“urged on by that being,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> who is more like
a god than a man. Urged on by him, I
urged on the others. Bolza watched, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
danced attendance. Funk fired, Maillard<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
advanced. I thanked, begged, thundered,
threatened, commanded; all was done, and
well done, in the twinkling of an eye.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles, who was Colonel, was in
command, and energetically seconded his
father, who caught a violent fever during the
siege, and was confined to his bed for some
days, at which he was very furious. He
writes to Marshal Lascy: “The Turkish
Caïques have been venturing too near Krieg-Insel
(my headquarters). ‘We must give
them a lesson,’ I said to my son, who at times
engaged with my own, at others with Marshal
Laudon’s column of attack; Charles, with
his usual liveliness, immediately threw himself
into a boat with my aides-de-camp, and,
followed by about forty other small boats,
went off to attack the Turkish Caïques.</p>

<p>“I directed the battle from my window,
in spite of a diabolical attack of fever, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
almost killed myself screaming to an Italian,
who commanded my frigate, the <i>Marie-Thérèse</i>:
‘<i>Alla larga!</i>’ and words which
I dare not write. Out of patience I finally
went myself to end this very peculiar naval
engagement.”</p>

<p>Belgrade was taken on the 8th of October
1789; Prince Charles had again the honour
of being first at the assault. Marshal Laudon,
who was not lavish of praise or flattery, wrote
to the Prince de Ligne the most complimentary
letter, in which he said: “More than
half the glory won by the taking of Belgrade
by right belongs to your Highness.”</p>

<p>The Emperor sent the Prince the cross
of Commander of the Order of Marie-Thérèse,
accompanied by a dry and cold letter, whose
purpose de Ligne could not unravel; but he
was still so ill with fever that both cross
and letter made but a slight impression. He
solved the riddle later on: Joseph II. had unjustly
suspected him of having encouraged
the rebellion in Flanders.</p>

<p>It is said that during the famous journey in Tauris he ordered
theatrical scenery to be constructed at intervals on the road along
which the Empress was expected to pass. This scenery represented in the distance villages, towns, and cities, and he
organised troops of supernumerary actors, who simulated the rural
population peacefully pursuing their avocations. Although he was
invested with offices and dignities more profitable one than the
other, he helped himself to the State monies, and accepted bribes
from foreign powers. Joseph II. and Frederick the Great loaded
him with presents and pensions, and in consequence of their
rivalry with regard to the Russian alliance, the first created him
Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, and the second offered to
assist him in obtaining for himself the Duchy of Courland. He
had no talent as a general in command, but was fortunate in
having under him good officers, who were able to carry on the war
operations against the Turks.</p>

for their long beards, which reached to their knees, on account of
their short stirrups, and the fear they were in on horseback, gave
them the appearance of monkeys. The anxiety they felt could be
read in their eyes, and the long pikes they carried in a most
comical manner made them look as if they were trying to mimic
the Cossacks. I do not know what cursed <i>Pope</i> (Russian priest)

de Witt, Governor of Bessarabia, entertained the ambassador, and
was so struck with the beauty of the Greek slave that he fell
desperately in love with her.</p>

<p>In order to deceive his guest, he arranged a hunting party, which
was to meet at a great distance from the fortress, and, excusing
himself on the ground of a sudden order, remained behind. Hardly
had the ambassador left than de Witt closed the gates, and
celebrated his marriage with Sophie. On returning in the evening,
the ambassador was much surprised to find the gates closed; an
envoy was sent, who informed him of what had taken place; he
thought it useless to contend against an accomplished fact, and

<p>The Turkish war had seemingly caused a
happy diversion from Polish affairs, and for
the last two or three years that country
had enjoyed a most unusual state of peace.
Russia, entirely absorbed by her important
wars in Turkey and in Sweden, was apparently
oblivious of her existence. Austria, on
her side, took little heed, and was satisfied
with the large share that had been ceded
to her in the first dismemberment that had
taken place. But this lull could not continue.
Prussia was secretly making overtures to the
Poles, and trying to prevent Stanislaus from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
sending his promised reinforcements to the
Russians.</p>

<p>The Polish nobility, always restless and
disunited, were anxious to take advantage of
Russia’s difficulties, but could not agree on
the course likely to ensure success. The
majority, however, tempted by Prussia’s secret
promises, were disposed to listen to her
advances, and conclude with her a defensive
alliance. A new constitution, more in harmony
with the actual state of Poland, was
also a question of debate, and the public
mind, now thoroughly roused, anticipated
with increasing interest the meeting of the
Diet.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The King summoned it to meet on the
6th of October 1788. The arrival of all
the nuncios, accompanied by their numerous
retinues, part of which came from the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
distant Palatinates, imparted to Warsaw an
unusually animated appearance; and the
town offered at that time attractions of a
most unique character.</p>

<p>The great Polish lords, who habitually
lived on their estates, had retained manners
and customs that partook of an uncivilised
magnificence. They nearly all possessed
palaces in Warsaw, but only inhabited them
during the Diets—that is to say, for six weeks
every two years; and these large residences
presented the most curious mixture of luxury
and penury. After passing through empty
halls, where the ceilings were falling to pieces,
and the hangings were all mouldy from the
damp, one came upon drawing-rooms with
ornamented frescoes, and with gold and
blue vaulted ceilings. The ante-rooms were
crowded with lacqueys in tattered liveries,
and with poor gentlemen who, attending as
servants upon the great lords, proudly wore
the ancient Polish costumes. Though they
did not give at Warsaw, as in the Palatinates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
gigantic feasts, during which the
toasts were accompanied by a salute of artillery,
yet they did not completely abandon
all the old customs, and the master of the
house would still occasionally honour the lady
of his thoughts by sending round her tiny
shoe, full of champagne or Tokay.</p>

<p>The tone of the best French society
reigned at the Polish Court with a mixture
of oriental peculiarities. European good
taste was combined with that of Asia, and the
polished manners of civilised countries did
not exclude the hospitality common to those
beyond the pale.</p>

<p>A revival took place in Polish literature
during the reign of Stanislaus-Augustus.
The King patronised learning, and encouraged
to his utmost the reorganisation of
the universities. After the suppression of
the Jesuits the funds obtained by the sale of
their property were entirely applied to this
object. A regular committee was appointed
to superintend the national education. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Bishop of Wilna was one of its most influential
members; he created at his own
expense a professorship of anatomy at the
university of Wilna, which was the first that
existed in Poland.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Stanislaus-Augustus
the Court was celebrated for its pleasures, its
love intrigues, and its pretty women; their
beauty had become proverbial. Among the
beauties of that time were the Princess Lubomirska,
whom we have already heard of
under the name of Princesse Maréchale; her
sister-in-law, the fascinating Princess Czartoryska,
a Fleming by birth; the Countess
Potocka, an Ossolinska by birth; and the
Princess Charles of Courland. The two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
latter were really beautiful, and all four were
intelligent women. It was asserted that the
first one made the fortune of those she loved,
the second robbed them of it, and the two
others simply enjoyed themselves without
thinking of anything else. The Princess
Langorouska and the Countess Branicka, the
Princess André Poniatowska, sister-in-law
to the King, the Princess Lubomirska, a
Haddik by birth, also ranked high at Court,
where all the affairs of the State were the
mainspring of society. The King, who was
weak, indulgent, and always in love, was
governed by the favourite of the moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span><a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
The Prince, during his short stay at Warsaw,
soon perceived these weak points, and he
says: “The King is too honest a man with
women, as he is indeed with all his subjects;
he is genuinely in love, and inconstant with
the greatest possible sincerity; and thus he
often throws himself into the arms of his
opponents, deserting and ruining his own
cause.”</p>

<p>Such was the Court at which the Princess
Charles was to shine. Her reputation
for intelligence, beauty, and coquetry having
already attracted the attention of all, her
Polish nationality, elegance, talents, and the
evident pleasure she showed on returning
to her native land, delighted her fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>Her empty palace, rapidly metamorphosed
by her own able hands, became one of the
most elegant in Warsaw, and she availed herself
of the opportunity to display the remarkable
domestic qualities she possessed, and
which had been so little appreciated by her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
mother-in-law. During the latter time of her
stay at Bel Œil her husband had forbidden
her to ride, on account of her delicate health;
she now amply made up for that privation.
The Prince-Bishop, who thoroughly spoilt
her, gave her the most beautiful horses, and
she might be seen every morning on horseback
escorted by several young noblemen who
were perfect horsemen, as are all the Poles.
She built a theatre in her palace, and gratified
her love of acting to her heart’s content.</p>

<p>Freed from the supervision that oppressed
her at Bel Œil, Hélène abandoned herself
without constraint to the irresistible charms of
this life of pleasure. She forgot the past, her
husband, and her daughter even; the Princesse
Charles de Ligne no longer existed—Hélène
Massalska alone remained.</p>

<p>Winter was rapidly drawing to a close, and
the Princess still gave no thought to Vienna.
The de Ligne family, justly offended at her
prolonged absence, preserved a disdainful
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>The Prince-Bishop had returned to Wilna
during the vacation of the Diet, but his
niece, who wished to enjoy the summer season,
just then beginning, remained alone at
Warsaw.</p>

<p>The King, his family, and the most important
personages at Court, had elegant country-houses
in the suburbs, where they indulged
in the most sumptuous and original festivities.
The greatest luxury was displayed in these
entertainments, where each host endeavoured
to surpass his neighbour in planning surprises
and unforeseen effects. The first one at which
the Princess Charles appeared was given by
the Princess André Poniatowska. “The
heat on that day had been suffocating; the
Prince led his visitors to a grotto formed by
an artificial rock, from which fell a cascade,
imparting by its very sound a cool and agreeable
sensation. Then they all went into the
grotto, where they rested for a few minutes on
the soft mossy banks, after which the Prince
proposed a walk in the park. They entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
a shady avenue leading to a door, which was
hidden in the foliage; he touched a spring,
the door flew open, and disclosed a magnificent
circular hall, splendidly illuminated, and
painted with frescoes representing allegorical
subjects; it was surrounded by niches in the
walls containing Turkish divans, which were
covered with the richest brocades. The back
of these recesses was of a dead gold, contrasting
marvellously with the black hair and delicate
complexion of the Polish ladies who came
to rest in them. They had barely seated
themselves when strains of music were heard,
which seemed to descend mysteriously from
the skies. Suddenly the floor opened, and a
table, magnificently laid out, slowly ascended,
as if at the touch of a fairy’s wand.” The
King seated himself, and motioned the desired
guests to their places, Princesse Hélène
being among the number.</p>

<p>Stanislaus was most agreeably disposed;
he was fond of conversation, and set every
one at ease. He liked to speak on art and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
literature; his mind, which was cultivated,
though without much depth, appeared at
these entertainments under its most favourable
aspect, Paris and France were the
topics of conversation, and as they recalled
the delightful past, the King took pleasure in
questioning Hélène about the people whom
he had known.</p>

<p>When supper was over they again went
into the park, and wandered about in the
beautiful moonlight, returning only to Warsaw
when the night was far advanced.</p>

<p>Hélène had become particularly intimate
with the Princess Czartoryska, so passionately
loved by Lauzun, and of whom he has left
a charming description.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The Princess’s residence
was entirely different from any of the
others; for Powinski was laid out in what
we now call the <i>realistic</i> style.</p>

<p>Each member of the family occupied a
cottage, the exact reproduction of a peasant’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
hut; it was made with trunks of trees laid
one on the other, cemented together by
a mixture of earth and straw: “Madame
la Princesse inhabited a very large hut;
those of the children and servants were
smaller. This group of cottages looked like
a village in the midst of an immense park;
but, on entering one of them, one was struck
by the sumptuousness of the apartments
which greeted the eye. The finish and
elegance of the decorations were on a
scale of which one single detail will give
an idea. The bathroom of the Princess
was lined from top to bottom with tiles
of Dresden china, painted with the utmost
delicacy, and each representing a small
picture: they numbered, it is said, three
thousand.</p>

<p>“After leaving these would-be cottages, and
crossing a part of the park, one came upon an
enormous Turkish tent, of a magnificent and
curious appearance. It had belonged to the
Vizier, and was taken during the war between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
the Russians and the Turks. The
interior was ornamented with Oriental hangings
and trophies of Turkish arms, which were
exceedingly beautiful. On the ground were
rich carpets, and piles of gold-embroidered
cushions used as seats made the illusion
perfect. Behind the heavy curtains sounds
of Turkish music were heard, and servants
dressed in Eastern costumes served pipes
and coffee on small low tables, inlaid with
mother-of-pearl.” Every reception-day the
park, lakes, rivers, and bridges were illuminated,
and supper was served the whole
evening in a large pavilion covered with
creepers, and open on all sides. A number
of small tables were laid out, and at each
one of the ladies presided. A ball was organised
in the Princess’s cottage, where they
danced most of the night.</p>

<p>After enjoying these gaieties for some
time, Hélène joined her uncle at Werky.
With the exception of a few short holidays,
the Diet, contrary to the usual custom, sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
without interruption and without fresh elections
till the year 1792. During these four
years, and notwithstanding the critical nature
of the political questions under discussion,
the Court of Stanislaus presented an unusually
brilliant aspect, which, however, was
not destined to last.</p>

<p>While the Diet was sitting all the Crown
officials were obliged by their duties to reside
in Warsaw. Amongst those who attracted
the most notice was the Lord High Chamberlain,
Count Vincent Potocki. He belonged
to one of the most illustrious families in Poland,
and possessed immense landed estates
and palaces of regal magnificence. His
father, Stanislaus-Potocki, Palatine of Kiew,
was the nephew and godson of the King
Stanislaus-Leczinski, and therefore first cousin
of the late Queen of France.</p>

<p>Although at this time the Lord Chamberlain
was nearly thirty-eight years of age, he
passed for one of the most fascinating men
at Court. Gifted with a keen and refined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
intellect, very careful of his own interests, a
favourite with women, and always on the
best of terms with influential men, he knew
the art of being successful with every one.</p>

<p>His first wife was Ursule Zamoiska,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
niece of King Stanislaus-Augustus; they
had no children, and were divorced at the
end of a few years. Divorces were of such
frequent occurrence in Poland, and had become
such an established custom, that this
event made no difference in the Count’s
position with the King. Shortly after her
divorce Princess Zamoiska married the
Count Mniseck, and Count Vincent himself
married in 1786 the Countess Micielska, by
whom he had two sons. It was just at the
time of the birth of his second son that the
Count was summoned by his duties to Warsaw.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
The Countess remained at Ukrania,
in a property near Niemirow, their habitual
residence, her health not yet permitting her
to travel.</p>

<p>The Lord Chamberlain, on arriving at
Warsaw, met the Princesse Hélène at his
cousins, Mesdames Jean and Severin Potocka;
he was presented to her, and soon
became one of the most faithful followers
of her little Court. Hitherto Hélène, like
a real coquette, had noticed all her admirers
without seeming to distinguish any, but it
was soon apparent that she received Count
Vincent with marked favour. Her habits
changed entirely, she went much less into
society, and was only seen at the houses
which the Count himself habitually frequented.
He showed the greatest reserve in his intercourse
with the Princess. Either from
policy or prudence, he manifested no eagerness,
and even affected to avoid meeting
her too often; it was easy, however, for
an attentive observer to see that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
flattered at the distinction with which he
was treated by a young, beautiful, and most
attractive woman.</p>

<p>Hélène, who was in love for the first time in
her life, gave herself up completely to the feelings
which influenced her. Without admitting
it to herself, she felt keenly the Count’s coldness
of manner towards her, and endeavoured
to find out its cause; she thought he disapproved
of her worldly pursuits, and she hoped
to please him by giving them up: the pleasure
parties, the brilliant cavalcades, were all
abandoned. She courted solitude, and in her
letters to her friends betrayed, unawares, her
secret thoughts: here is an answer from the
Princesse Henri Lubomirska, then living in
Paris, which shows that her passion was no
longer a secret:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>15th October 1789</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“At last, pussie, I have received a letter
from you, dated the 24th of September. It
is a thousand and a hundred thousand years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
since I had heard from you, and I even felt
a little cross, I must confess. But, after
seeing in your letter such big phrases as
<i>actual situation</i>, <i>settled for ever</i>, etc., I have
cooled down, for, like Germain in <i>La Feinte
par Amour</i>,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> ‘What I am not told I know
nevertheless.’ Really I am sorry that I
cannot see you in <i>this new situation, which
makes solitude</i> so precious. You must be
very funny, not that I think the sentimental
style altogether unbecoming to you; there
are privileged beings whom every phase
suits, and this can be said of you more than
of anybody; but I cannot suppress a certain
curiosity,—forgive me for it, my pet. Your
happiness is my most ardent wish, and I am
more interested than ever in desiring it, since
the longer it lasts the longer you will remain
with us. Tell me what terms you are on
with Madame de Mniseck;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> I have good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
reasons for asking, and you will understand
them; but do not mention my question to
anybody, and when you see the Lord
Chamberlain, present him with my compliments.</p>

<p>“Is it true that he is irrevocably settled
at Warsaw, and has given up Niemirow?</p>

<p>“By the bye, why were you astonished that
in a letter dated from Paris I should have
sent you the Comte Auguste’s<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> compliments?
It was not on the high-road, but here, where
he is deputy at the States-General, that I saw
him. I will not mention my health; it is too
tiresome a subject. Neither will I write
about what goes on here, as political matters
do not interest you much; and, moreover,
you see everything in the newspapers. So
good-bye, my puss; write often; you know
that your letters are always a great pleasure
to me. Are you still fond of riding and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
going to the theatre? I am afraid you have
given up all these amusements. Forgive my
surmises; at a distance of five hundred
leagues one may sometimes make a mistake,
and see things in a wrong light; but at least
believe that no distance can diminish the
tender interest I feel for you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Evidently Hélène’s friend knew perfectly
all that was going on; her question with
regard to the Comtesse de Mniseck proves it.
She wished to know on what footing the two
young women were with each other. Hélène
had naturally become intimate with her.
Madame de Mniseck was only too glad that
the Count should be faithless to her successor.
We have already seen that Hélène was
extremely worried by the Count’s coldness
and reserve towards herself; she could not
refrain from mentioning it to Madame de
Mniseck, who, according to the singular
Polish habit, had remained on perfectly
courteous terms with her first husband. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
is not necessary to add that the word <i>love</i>
was never mentioned between them; they
only recognised an “affectionate regard,” and
Hélène implored her friend to discover the
cause of the Count’s strange behaviour.
Madame de Mniseck graciously fulfilled this
strange commission, and reassured Hélène so
completely that she wrote as follows to the
Count:—</p>

<p>“Madame de Mniseck has just told me
that you have spoken of me in affectionate
terms to her, and that you reproach yourself
with having left me for three months in doubt
as to your sentiments.</p>

<p>“I am deeply touched at this; your
affection is precious to me, and will always
be so, and, as I felt that I had not been in
fault, I was sure your good heart would
bring you back to me sooner or later.”</p>

<p>It is evident that little by little the
intimacy between the Count and Hélène
was increasing. Perhaps he was unconsciously
fascinated by the very great charm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
of the young Princess? Perhaps in the
Bishop of Wilna’s immense fortune he hoped
to find a resource for freeing his lands from
their heavy mortgages? It is difficult to tell,
for, in this circumstance, as in all those connected
with the Count, the motive of his
conduct remains an enigma.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, he accepted the
delicate responsibility of managing Hélène’s
affairs, which had been in a state of great
confusion for some time. The Count had
an undoubted capacity for business—a rare
quality in a Polish noble; they generally
know how to spend their fortune better
than how to manage it.</p>

<p>The advice which he gave the Princess
was a pretext for frequent interviews, which
always took place in the presence of a third
person, either a secretary or a young lady.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
One day, however, Hélène received a note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
from the Count begging for a private interview.
Surprised and disturbed at the receipt
of these few lines, Hélène, without reflecting
on their undoubted significance, replied that
she would grant his request, but only on
condition that he would remember she was
another man’s wife.</p>

<p>The Count arrived at the appointed time,
and after a few minutes of the most trivial
conversation, Hélène, agitated and trembling,
asked him, without reflecting on the purport
of her words, why he had demanded this
interview. He answered rather coldly that
she appeared to be aware of it already; and
he then made her a regular declaration. The
young Princess, carried away by the violence
of her feelings, admitted that she loved him
as she had never loved any one before, but
that she was determined that this confession
should lead to no result so long as they had
not each recovered their liberty.</p>

<p>The Count calmly replied that he was
proud of the distinction conferred, that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
sufficient for his happiness, and that his
reserve and respect would prove that he was
an honourable man. He then made a deep
obeisance and retired, leaving Hélène in a
most agitated frame of mind.</p>

<p>She felt more humiliated than satisfied
with what had taken place; for, in accordance
with a very natural sentiment, she had wished
to maintain a discreet behaviour, with the
intention of taking all the credit to herself;
she had prepared to combat an ardent lover,
and she had found herself face to face with
a man who was able not only to master his
feelings, but was even more reasonable than
she was.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied with herself, with him, and
with the rash admission she had just made,
she wrote and tore up three or four letters
after his departure; at last she sent him the
following:—</p>

<p>“I have tried three times to write to you,
without having been able to express the agitation
of my heart. How changed are my prospects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
since yesterday! I feel humiliated, degraded....
I granted the very first request
you made, but I wished to place between us
a barrier which your delicacy of feeling would
respect. On reflection I perceive that my
surrender has only added to my imprudence.
I have shown you my weakness, whilst you
have shown me how honour should control
nature. I forgot myself whilst you remembered;
this is not the moment to
claim your esteem, time alone will restore it
to me.</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>—My thoughts are so full of yesterday’s
events that I have not been able to
close my eyes. Can it be possible that a
single day should thus influence my life; I
feel that, henceforth, it is yours, and yours
alone!”</p>

<p>Hélène spoke truly, for this affection,
already so deeply rooted, was to last all her
life.</p>

<p>It appears that the Count replied in a way
that sufficed to dispel the anxiety of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
young Princess; for he received the following
note from her, which we find carefully preserved
amongst her other letters.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>“The few words you have written have
filled me with joy. I read and reread them
ten times whilst dressing, and I found the
pastime a sweet one. I shall see you this
evening at Madame Jean’s.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>We do not possess any of the letters which
the Count wrote at that time; but, judging
by Hélène’s answers, he must have been a
jealous and despotic man. She submitted to
his tyranny in a most extraordinary manner.
He insisted on her burning all the letters
she had received from her husband and her
friends, and made so severe a selection among
her numerous acquaintances at Warsaw, that
little by little he narrowed her sphere to a
small circle, in which he reigned supreme;
Hélène accepted everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“I wrote to you last night, and intended
sending off my note this morning,” she writes,
“but when I awoke it was too late.</p>

<p>“What is it that worries you? Tell me
at once. If a complete sacrifice of all that
displeases you can secure your peace of mind,
say but one word, and it will cost me nothing.
I shall consider myself the gainer if, by giving
up everything, I am able to make you happy
and contented.</p>

<p>“If these ladies had not insisted on my
going with them, I would willingly have
stayed at home.</p>

<p>“With you alone I have enough to occupy
my heart and mind without requiring the
presence of others.”</p>

<p>About this time, that is, towards the end
of 1790, the Comtesse Vincent, who had
completely recovered her health, left Ukrania,
and joined her husband at Warsaw. It was
impossible to prevent her return, and equally
impossible to conceal from her the growing
intimacy between the Lord Chamberlain and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the Princesse de Ligne, whose reputation of
coquetry and beauty had already reached her
ears.</p>

<p>The Comtesse Anna adored her husband,
and in spite of all his efforts to hide
the truth from her she soon discovered it,
and absolutely refused to admit the Princess
within her doors. “I shall never consent,”
she said to her husband, “to receive the woman
who has robbed me of your affection, whatever
may be the nature of your intimacy.” The
Count, very much surprised at this unexpected
resistance on her part, vainly endeavoured to
dispel his wife’s suspicion, but when Hélène
called on the Countess she found the door
closed. Mortally wounded by this affront,
she gave way to all the violence of her
character; she declared to the Count that
she insisted on his compelling his wife to
receive her, adding that she could never
rest under an insult that dishonoured her
in the eyes of the world. The Count, after
trying in vain to calm her, finally flew into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
passion, and after a terrible scene abruptly
left her. Utterly upset by the manner in
which the Count had left her on the previous
day, Hélène sent him the very next
morning these few lines, written in such a
state of agitation as to be almost illegible:—</p>

<p>“I am writing to you without knowing how
to begin. What a scene! I am still quite
unnerved by it; you have left me, abandoned
me, and nothing remains to alleviate my
despair. I am alone in the world. I have
neglected my friends, broken all ties, burnt
under your eyes all the proofs of the affection
which my husband once bestowed on me. I
have destroyed secrets, confidences, assurances
of tenderness from the friends of my childhood,
and yesterday you retracted the few words of
affection which have at times escaped your
lips. Who will console me in my affliction?
I leave it to you to imagine what remains
after this. Good-bye, my dear Vincent; in
any case, should I meet you again, you will
always be the eternal object of my affections,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
and should nothing bring you back to me,
that of my eternal regrets. In any case you
alone will occupy all my thoughts, and possess
till death all my affection.</p>

<p>“If you are determined never to see me
again, return my letters, and at the end of
this one write: <i>Adieu</i>. This sentence, to be
decreed by your hand, is the only favour I
solicit from you.”</p>

<p>This note was returned to the Princess,
a few minutes later, by the messenger who
had taken it. The seal was unbroken,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
but on it were traced two lines, in the
Comtesse Anna’s own handwriting, with the
following words: “The Count left this
morning for Niemirow.” This news filled
Hélène with dismay; she fancied the
Countess rejoicing at her grief, triumphing
in his departure, and preparing to join her
husband and her children. A mad idea shot
through her brain; she rang at once, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
ordered a post-chaise to be brought round
immediately. Half an hour later the Princess
threw herself into the carriage, accompanied
by only one of her women, and after a journey
of astounding rapidity arrived at Niemirow
a few hours after the Count.</p>

<p>The latter had left Warsaw merely to
escape from a position that was no longer
bearable, and without any settled resolution.
The unexpected arrival of Hélène completely
unnerved him; her beauty, her tenderness,
her despair, the rashness of her conduct in
thus sacrificing her reputation, all combined
to move and perplex him, and the recollection
of poor Comtesse Anna could not contend
against the fascination of the moment.
Hélène carried the day, and when the emotion
of the first few moments was over they
agreed to ask for a divorce on both sides.</p>

<p>The Princess, dreading lest the Count
should change his mind, urged that their
plans should be carried out without delay,
and the very next day three letters were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
despatched from Niemirow, the first addressed
to the Comtesse Anna, the second to
the Prince de Ligne, and the third to the
Bishop of Wilna. The Count offered his
wife the custody of their two sons, besides a
large annuity, if she would consent to the
divorce. The Princess requested that her
daughter Sidonie should be sent back to her,
and that the Prince-Bishop and a trustee
appointed by her, and invested with her full
authority, should settle all questions of interest
with the de Ligne family. Then, in a letter
to her uncle, she informed him of her intended
divorce, asking him not to withdraw
his sympathy from her, and help her in the
settlement of her affairs.</p>

<p>The Comtesse Anna was in total ignorance
of what had taken place; her husband’s letter
told her the sad truth. The unhappy woman
could as yet hardly believe in the reality of
the blow which had fallen upon her. She
had scarcely been married four years, and
her unvarying gentleness and blameless character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
ought to have secured to her the lasting
affection of the husband she adored, and
whose fondest wish had been fulfilled by the
birth of two sons. She still hoped that this
intimacy would be but a passing fancy, and
refused to consent to a divorce.</p>

<p>Her answer was simple and touching:—</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten,” she said, “that we
married out of mutual sympathy, and not
only with the consent but by the wish of our
parents? These ties were to last for ever;
and God sanctioned and blessed them by
granting us children. You have sometimes
been weak, but I shall still persevere, being
fully persuaded that both my duty and my
happiness are involved....</p>

<p>“I shall always remember that when Francis
was born you were on your knees in the
adjoining room, praying to God for me and
for our child. You loved us then, and if you
searched your inmost heart, you would still
find these two sentiments there, for I believe
nothing could ever efface them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“You see my heart and soul laid bare
before you; read your own; one word, only
one, and I will forget everything; I await it
with the greatest impatience.</p>

<p>“Your very humble and very obedient
servant,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Anna Potocka</span>.”<br>
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This letter and many others remained
without effect; the Lord Chamberlain had
already made up his mind. Not only was
he completely under the charm of Hélène’s
fascination, but, as we said before, the prospect
of the immense fortune she would
possess singularly strengthened his determination.</p>

Czartoryski in the Emperor Alexander’s councils greatly assisted this
movement. He purchased the magnificent library of the King
Stanislaus-Augustus, which, added to his own, became the most
important depository of Slavonic history and literature. It was

great lords by all sorts of amusements and distinctions. It would
then be possible to retain in the kingdom all the money which
the pettiest noble, as soon as he has cut his mustachios and
left off his long respectable coat, thinks necessary to carry off to
Paris, and spend with women, tailors, hotels, and hairdressers, and
in gambling and paying off the police, with whom he is always
getting into trouble.” Unfortunately the King himself set the example
of thus abandoning the ancient Polish customs in favour of
the French.</p>

<p>While these romantic events were taking
place in Ukrania others of a more serious
nature were occurring in Flanders. Van der
Noot, uniting his efforts to those of Vonck
and Van der Mersch, had issued a manifesto
exhorting the people of Brabant to
rebellion, and on the same day, the 24th of
October 1789, the little army of patriots
assembled at Hasselt had invaded the Belgian
territory.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The Emperor, suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
alarmed, tried to arrest the movement by
making useless concessions; the violent irritation
he felt at the defection of Flanders
caused him to suspect every one belonging to
the country of taking part in the rebellion.
The Prince de Ligne himself, then at the
siege of Belgrade, did not escape his displeasure,
and it was then that he wrote him
the harsh letter we have already mentioned.
But Joseph soon recognised the injustice of
his suspicions, and the Prince de Ligne was
recalled. The latter obeyed at once, and
wrote the following charming letter to the
Emperor:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Belgrade</span>, <i>November 1789</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“I am overjoyed at your Majesty’s kindness
in permitting me to appear before you,
and to remain in Vienna until I start for
Moravia or Silesia at the head of the army
now returning from Syrmia. I am far more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
touched, Sire, by a grace than by a disgrace.
The cares of the siege of Belgrade,
and the fever from which I suffered, that no
amount of quinine could subdue, prevented
my feeling the grief I should naturally have
had on reading the terrible phrase: ‘Prepare
yourself to receive marks of my displeasure,
for it is neither my pleasure nor my habit to
be disobeyed.’ I had reason to congratulate
myself on my behaviour, Sire, during the Bavarian
war eleven years ago, and you thanked
me for it. On this occasion, it is true, your
Majesty decided that my despatches should be
conveyed to you through an orderly; but if I
made use of my aides-de-camp, it was solely
on account of the Comte de Choiseul’s special
message from Constantinople, recommending
that his very important despatch to the Marquis
de Noailles should be conveyed as safely
and directly as possible. An orderly may fall
asleep, get drunk, or be murdered.</p>

<p>“I must crave your pardon, Sire, if I
showed no anxiety at your displeasure, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
know your justice still better; I supposed
that the ill-timed journey made by one of
my aides-de-camp to Flanders when the rebellion
was at its height had perhaps led
your Majesty to suppose that I was concerned
in it, and that I had some understanding
with the disaffected.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whilst the Prince de Ligne was returning
to Vienna the insurgents seized Ghent and
Brussels, and on the 2d of December 1789
they proclaimed that Joseph II. had forfeited
the sovereignty of the Netherlands. Two
months later the Emperor succumbed to a
chronic disease, aggravated by grief and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
anxiety.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The Prince de Ligne wrote to the
Empress Catherine: “He is no more, Madame,—he
is no more, the Prince who honoured the
man, the man who still more honoured the
Prince. He said to me a few days before
his death, on my return from the Hungarian
army which I had led into Silesia: ‘I was
not fit to see you yesterday; your country has
killed me.... The capture of Ghent is
my agony, and the abandonment of Brussels
my death. What an outrage’ (he repeated
that word several times). ‘I am dying of it:
one would have to be of stone to survive it.
I thank you for all you have done for me.
Laudon has spoken very well of you; I thank
you for your fidelity. Go into Flanders;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
bring back the country to its allegiance. If
you cannot succeed, remain there; do not
sacrifice your interests to me—you have
children....’”</p>

<p>On the Emperor’s table were found
several letters, written on the eve of his
death. One of them, which was in French,
was addressed to the Princesses François
and Charles de Lichtenstein, and to the
Comtesses Clary, de Kinsky, and de Kaunitz.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To the Five Ladies who so kindly
received Me into their Society.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The time has come for me to bid you an
eternal farewell, and express all the gratitude
I feel at the condescension and kindliness
you have shown me for so many years. The
memory of each day is dear to me, and the
thought of separation is the only one that
troubles me. Wholly trusting in the goodness
of Providence, I submit myself entirely
to its decrees. Keep me in remembrance,
and do not forget me in your prayers. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
writing will show you the condition I
am in.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince de Ligne was deeply affected
by this loss, of which he soon felt the painful
results. Leopold II., who succeeded his
father, behaved with marked coldness towards
all those for whom Joseph had had any
affection. Moreover, the new sovereign’s
policy had nothing in common with that of
his predecessor. On the 27th of July 1790
Austria signed at Reichenbach a Convention
with Prussia, by which she agreed to make
peace with Turkey, the conditions to be
based on the <i>status quo</i> that existed before
the war.</p>

<p>Prince Charles, foreseeing a period of
forced inaction, asked and obtained permission
to enter the Russian service. He
accordingly set off, leaving his father in
Vienna unfavourably looked upon at Court,
and grieved at being separated from him.</p>

<p>It was under Souvarof’s orders in Bessarabia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
that Prince Charles fought his campaign.
He was selected to conduct part of
the operations at the famous siege of Ismaïl.[1]</p>

<p>Since the 19th Souvarof had been battering
the walls of the town; he directed in
person the assault by land, while another
attack was being made from the river.
Three times the Russians were driven back
under a terrific fire; two columns remained
for three hours in the trenches exposed to a
perfect storm of grape shot. At last a fire
broke out in the town, and the Russians
were able to enter, the assault having lasted
ten hours. Prince Charles was amongst the
first to go up, and behind him followed, as
simple volunteers, the Duc de Richelieu,
the Comte Roger de Damas, the Comte
de Langeron, etc. etc. Fifteen thousand</p>

<p>1 Ismaïloff, a town of Russia in Europe (Bessarabia), situated on
the Danube. The storming of Ismaïl is one of the most celebrated
in history. The Russians, numbering 30,000, took possession of
the town on 22d November 1790, and pillaged it for three days.
The Russians, exasperated at the resistance they had met with,
massacred two-thirds of the inhabitants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Turks were massacred, and the town was
given up to pillage. Prince Charles received
a wound in the leg, which, however, did not
stop him.</p>

<p>General Ribas, who commanded the flotilla
in the Danube, wrote to the Prince de Ligne
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Ismaïl</span>, <i>15th December</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Prince</span>—In recalling myself to the
notice of your serene Highness, I venture to
congratulate you on the glory that Prince
Charles has won at the storming of Ismaïl.
The column he commanded, following the
example of its daring leader, was the first
to effect a landing. In spite of a severe
wound in his leg he was the first to leap
out of the boat, and he scaled the ramparts
of the town under a deadly fire. He took
possession of it, after setting fire to a Turkish
frigate that was doing us great damage,
and after establishing and directing the battery,
which inflicted the greatest loss on the
enemy.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>At the moment of Prince Charles’s entry
into Ismaïl, and in the midst of the fire and
pillage and the fearful carnage, he saw a child
three or four years old standing alone under
the doorway of a fine-looking house, and uttering
the most heartrending cries; his beauty
and the richness of his attire attracted the
attention of the Prince; he took up the child
in his arms; it ceased crying, and looked at
him with eyes full of astonishment; then, terrified
at the tumult and the horrible scenes
going on around them, he hid his face on
his deliverer’s breast, clinging to his neck
with all the strength of his little arms.
Much moved, the Prince hastily carried
the child to a place of safety, and had it
questioned by some prisoners who had escaped
the massacre. All he could say
was that he was called Norokos, and that
his mother and the women who took care of
him had been killed. The Prince chose
among the prisoners a Turkish man and
woman, gave the child into their keeping,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
and commanded that he should receive every
possible care, as he had decided to adopt
him, and take him to Vienna on his return.</p>

<p>Immediately after the taking of Ismaïl the
Empress Catherine wrote to Prince Charles to
tell him herself of his promotion to the rank of
colonel, and to confer on him the cross of
commander of the order of Saint Georges.</p>

<p>The Prince de Ligne was at Vienna when
he received the news of the capture of
Ismaïl, and of the honours the Empress had
bestowed on his son. He had just been
slighted and treated with flagrant injustice by
Leopold II., but he forgot everything on
hearing of his Charles’s success, and wrote
the same day to the Czarina:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madame</span>—My heart, which bounds forward
so quickly that my pen is unable to keep
pace with it, can never sufficiently express my
gratitude for the favours bestowed by your
Imperial Majesty on my excellent and fortunate
Charles. I shall not publish the letter you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
have deigned to write to me, but shall content
myself with never forgetting it. Not
until we have peace will your Majesty regain
your former wit, as during the last four years
you have been all soul and genius. Good
heavens, what abundant proof of it there is
in your letter to my good Charles! I am
afraid it will have put him quite beside himself....”</p>
</div>

<p>But it is with his son that the Prince gives
himself up to the full vehemence of his
feelings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, <i>25th November 1790</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“So you end the war, as you began it, by
making me die of anxiety on behalf of the
most courageous of mortals, of joy at possessing
such a son, of emotion at your conduct,
and of regret at never having equalled your
merit in any quarter.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> My dear Charles, in
spite of these four deaths, I am quite alive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and the happiest of men, for I am going to
see you again. My God! good Charles,
brave Charles, what anxiety you have given
me! Mine is the high stake! If they
had <i>néboïsséd</i><a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> you, as they sometimes do
(and for two or three nights especially the
thought deprived me of sleep), say, what
in the world would have become of me?
Supposing I had survived, could I have
existed a minute without reproaching myself
for my strength and weakness in not opposing
your departure?...”</p>
</div>

<p>Almost immediately after the peace of Ismaïl
the Empress began secretly to negotiate a
treaty with the Turks. Preoccupied by events
in France, and especially in Poland, she was
anxious to be rid of a war which absorbed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
greatest part of her army. Prince Charles,
aware of what was going on, asked and
obtained his discharge. He announced his
return to Vienna to his father, and came back
escorted by a numerous retinue. He brought
with him the little Norokos and his attendants,
a Turkish band of twelve musicians,
and magnificent presents of arms and horses
that Marshal Souvarof and Prince Potemkin
had given him.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Prince de Ligne to his Son.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Good Lord! dear Charles! you are
coming back, but I cannot realise it. I
assure you that since you have had the good
fortune to escape from such dangers, you
must be physically immortal as well as morally.
I do not know how I shall manage to
kiss you, how I shall place myself, where
your large nose will go, how I shall manage
my own; I fully intend also kissing your
wounded knee, perhaps going down on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>

well as before heaven.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As for you, my dear Duke, I shall not
seek to express the feelings I entertain
on your behalf. It is impossible to be a
more worthy grandson of the Maréchal de
Richelieu, never has any one had a more
valiant and charming comrade. Both you
and Charles have equally contributed to each
other’s glory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>
<p>“Certain of your mutual esteem, you strove
to augment it. What happiness for me, dear
Duke, to know that you are full of life and
energy; to remember that I have loved you
from the time of your birth, for hardly had
you come into the world than you were
already its ornament.</p>

<p>“But I must tell you both about the King
of Naples. What a kind good man he is!
He embraced me about ten times, that is to
say, as often as he met me during the ball,
which took place at the house of his ambassador
Gallo.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> He took me up to every
one, saying: ‘<i>Suo figlio! ah! bravo juvene!

</div>

<p>The Flemish rebellion was drawing to a
close. After shaking off the Austrian yoke
the first act of the Flemish people had
been to divide into two hostile factions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
one of which was anxious to preserve the
ancient, aristocratic, and sacerdotal constitution,
to retain which had been the motive of
the revolution, while the other faction supported
the new doctrines of the constituent
assembly in Paris. Leopold, who had learnt
the art of negotiating in Tuscany, and was
an astute politician, cleverly took advantage
of the division of opinions, and on coming
to the throne<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> promised to restore to
Flanders all her ancient privileges, but at
the same time despatched an army strong
enough to subdue her if necessary. The
country offered no resistance.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>On the 2d of December 1790 Leopold
granted a general amnesty, and before many
months had passed all trace of the disturbances
in Flanders had disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>After enjoying for some time the happiness
of seeing her son, the Princesse de
Ligne left for Brussels and Bel Œil, in order
to repair the damages these residences had
sustained during the revolution, for they
had been abandoned ever since 1787. It
was precisely at this period that Hélène’s
letters asking for a divorce reached her
husband.</p>

<p>The de Ligne family had several times
expressed their displeasure at the prolonged
stay of the Princesse Charles in Poland. At
first she had answered evasively, then, having
inquired after her little daughter Sidonie,
she ceased writing altogether.</p>

<p>Hélène’s sudden departure and prolonged
stay in Ukrania had created a great sensation
in Warsaw. The Princesse Maréchale and
other great ladies, who were spending the
winter in Vienna, related the adventure, and
commented upon it. The Lignes, as may
easily be supposed, were greatly offended
at Hélène’s imprudent escapade, and, far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
from favourably receiving her request for a
divorce, they absolutely refused to consent
to it. It may be supposed that if the
lady whom he loved had been free, Prince
Charles would have sent a different answer,
but there existed, evidently, some insurmountable
obstacle to their union. Meanwhile the
Count, who directed all Hélène’s affairs,
started for Paris, invested by her with
full powers to treat with the Lignes; for
the Princesse Charles was still under the
delusion that her request would be granted.
On his arrival in Paris he had a first interview
with the Prince de Ligne’s steward, and
gave him a copy of his deed of authorization.</p>

<p>The steward went off at once to confer
with the Prince on these grave questions,
but when he returned to Paris he found that
the Count, who in the meantime had heard
from Hélène of Prince Charles’s decided
refusal, had already taken his departure.</p>

<p>The following is the letter the steward
had brought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Letter from the Prince de Ligne.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, <i>15th January 1791</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“As we no longer are aware of the Princesse
Charles de Ligne’s existence, and as, in
fact, she is dead to us and to our little Sidonie,
we can enter into no arrangements with her.</p>

<p>“A woman kept prisoner by a stupid Polish
tyrant should not prevent Sidonie’s great-uncle
from paying the bills of exchange, for
which he has given us every possible security,
and which, according to the desire of
Prince Charles and the Prince-Bishop,
and even according to that of her mother,
are destined to free the estates in Galicia.
She has neither the power nor the right to
administer these estates, as she is under the
influence of a man who publicly manages her
business, for in so doing she might damage
her daughter’s interests.</p>

<p>“When she chooses to free herself from
the bondage in which she is living, and take
up her residence either in Paris or Warsaw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
or on one of my estates if she prefers it, she
shall receive an annuity of thirty thousand
French livres, which is the least her husband
intends her to have, as soon as he shall
himself come into the whole of his fortune.</p>

<p>“As the Princesse Charles, if she married
the Count Potocki, would be even more unhappy
than she is at present, her husband,
in her interest and in that of her daughter,
will never give his consent.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Ligne.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“The Princess’s diamonds and the rest of
her property will be immediately returned to
her, and she must send to Pradel the drawings
belonging to her husband she still has in her
possession.”</p>
</div>

<p>Prince Charles wished to send back at
once all the diamonds, furniture, and effects
left by Hélène at Bel Œil and at Brussels,
and he wrote to his mother urging her to
forward them at once to their destination.
It will be remembered that Hélène had left
Brussels hurriedly at the time of the insurrection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
and therefore had not had time to discharge
a few personal debts contracted at her
own expense. The Princesse de Ligne wrote
to her daughter-in-law the following letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>24th February 1791</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“As your husband had written to me,
Madame, that he consented to the return
of everything belonging to you, with the
exception of the books, most of which already
formed a part of the library at Bel Œil, the
rest having been purchased on condition of
their being placed in it, I was about to
order the packing of your effects when your
creditors, hearing of this, came to oppose
the proceedings, alleging that they never
received any answer to the letters they sent
you. They will not allow the removal of the
effects, which are their guarantee; it is only
out of consideration for me, and on my
promising to write to you myself, that they
have consented to wait long enough for you
to receive this letter and send a reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“I therefore beg you, Madame, if you do
not wish to run the risk of having your things
publicly sold, to send me a bill of exchange
or an order on some bank, so that by the end
of April I may be able to meet their claims.</p>

<p>“The bills I have been able to collect,
added to those I already know of, amount
to about five thousand florins in our coin.
As I do not intend to be in Brussels after
the 15th of May, I warn you that unless I
receive the money by the first of the month,
I shall hand over your possessions to a public
auctioneer, who will estimate their value and
settle with the creditors, and I shall have
nothing more to do with it. You will
certainly not profit by this arrangement; for
I should have been more economical and
have taken more interest in your affairs than
he will.</p>

<p>“Sidonie is in excellent health; she is a
dear little thing, and although you hardly notice
her, she often speaks of you, and never
forgets to mention her mother in her little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
prayers. Impatiently awaiting your reply,
for, with the precautions I have taken, I am
certain this letter will reach you, I remain,
Madame, yours, etc.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">La Princesse de Ligne</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>During these negotiations Hélène was
living at Kowalowska in complete retirement.
Her mother-in-law’s letter arrived at a moment
when it was impossible for her to send any
money to Brussels. This woman of the world,
accustomed to the most refined luxury, was
almost in actual want, and with very natural
pride would accept nothing from the Count
but the hospitality he had offered her. She
wrote to him as follows:—</p>

<p>“Your letter has made me very sad.
There is no more question of your return
than if you were never coming back. MM.
de Ligne will listen to nothing; what can I
do? What line of action can I take? What
do they want of me? What is their object?
They apparently hope that want will make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
me submit to their will, and imagine they are
granting me a favour by shutting me up in a
Convent with a pension.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> But even should
they be willing to receive me back into their
family, I would never return to them; all is
at an end between them and me, and I should
even prefer the Convent to the trial of living
with people whom I do not love, and who
would despise me; the word alone makes
me shudder.</p>

<p>“As to the money question, it would be
most painful to me to be a burden to anybody
in the world; I would sooner live
by manual work, and would not hesitate to
begin by discarding all my household, and
keeping only one servant.</p>

<p>“The few effects I possess, such as books,
music, and some pieces of furniture, I no
longer consider as my own; you will be good
enough to take them into account in the sum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
I owe you for table expenses, washing, etc.;
for, as regards money, I can give you none.
I have made a purchase this month, which I
should have avoided had I known my affairs
were in such a bad state. I spent forty
ducats in buying linen to make chemises, for
I required some, and it was difficult for me to
do without them. I was shown some fine
linen, and as it is often difficult to procure,
I bought it. If I become a prey to absolute
misery, I shall yet have the necessary courage
to bear it. You will care as much for me in
sackcloth as in silk, and I shall be quite happy.
I do not wish even to return into society. I
became acquainted early in life with its most
brilliant attractions, and soon wearied of them;
I shall never get weary of a quiet life, even
attended with poverty, if you love me.”</p>

<p>The Princesse Charles was a prey to all
kinds of anxiety; her imagination was constantly
inventing dangers: “I am far from
being reassured,” she wrote to the Count;
“on the contrary, it seems to me that each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
moment increases my anxiety and worry.
I was told that on his return from Vienna the
<i>Krajczy</i> had gone to Dubus. If you meet
him I fear that he will encourage you to
separate from me; he will certainly have
known MM. de Ligne at Vienna; their
cause will have interested him, and he will
try to oblige them by urging you to abandon
me. This idea tortures me. Answer me
directly on this subject. Since Thursday I
have been abandoned to the melancholy
tenure of my thoughts, and that without any
hope of consolation; I am in great dread
lest your absence should be taken advantage
of to get you to give up all idea of our
union; do not ever expect my consent to this.
Should it be necessary for your happiness, I
am ready to release you from your vows, but
nothing will induce me to break those by which
I have bound myself to love you always.”</p>

<p>The Princess had received a very short
answer to the letter she had sent to the
Prince-Bishop. He had not written himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
but had replied through his steward that he
would reflect on the subject, and that he
refused for the time being to treat with
his niece’s delegate. Hélène wrote to the
Count, and added:—</p>

<p>“If my uncle will not abide by the settlement,
he has only to cancel it, and give me
back my lands. But to take possession of
my estates, and give me nothing in return, is
really too unjust, and I cannot believe my
uncle will let me die of hunger. It would be
infamous if, with the immense fortune I possess,
I were reduced to poverty by so cruel
an injustice, notwithstanding every law to the
contrary. God grant that I may escape the
clutches of Silvestrowicz<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> with a sufficient income
to be a burden to no one! But where is
my uncle? Can I despatch any one to him,
to explain my position and the ill-will of
Silvestrowicz? I shall find myself without a
<i>sol</i>,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and then what shall I do? tell me. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
how could it be possible for my uncle to rob
me so completely, without my obtaining any
redress? It is only in this country that such
a thing could take place. I am indeed very
unhappy, but I am so affected by your absence
that it prevents my dwelling upon my other
griefs, which, at this moment, are but a minor
part of my sorrows. Good-bye, Vincent;
love me, for your love is all I have left.”</p>

<p>The Count had just arrived in Poland,
but seemed in no hurry to return to Ukrania.</p>

<p>He wrote to Hélène that his own business
kept him away from her, but that she had
nothing to fear from the influences she had
mentioned in a former letter. “I am greatly
relieved,” she answers, “to hear at last that
you are in Poland, and to know that I have
nothing to fear from the <i>Krajczy</i>; his wife, his
daughter, and his sons are all intimate friends
of MM. de Ligne, and I dreaded lest he might
meddle with our affairs. As for myself, I
consider the engagement which bound us
to have been a fatal error, seeing we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
were so young, and that our only fitness consisted
in a mere similarity of birth and fortune.
To you alone I have given my pledge, my
real love, the most chaste and sacred of all
ties.”</p>

<p>A short time after Hélène had fresh
cause for anxiety. “Fancy,” she writes to the
Count, “I have read in the <i>Gazette de Hambourg</i>
that Prince Charles is about to return
to the Russian army by Léopol; he must
therefore pass by Niemirow, or at least quite
near it. I assure you that your Cossacks are
barely a sufficient protection to reassure a
coward like myself.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> But the Prince passed
through without troubling himself about her.</p>

<p>At last the Count announced his arrival.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
“How my heart beats,” writes Hélène,
“when I think that the moment is drawing
near which will bring you back to me. I am
so taken up by your return that whether you
have successfully or unsuccessfully settled
my business is a question which does not
interest me as it would at any other time. I
count the minutes, and can only speculate on
the hour at which you started, and the hour
at which you may arrive, and it seems to me
as though I had centuries to wait.</p>

<p>“I hope you will receive this letter on
your way. I have just received one from my
uncle; it appears that he <i>is not angry with
me, and, with the exception of helping me by
his influence or his money, is entirely devoted
to me</i>. What irony! But what can I do?
If my family is indifferent to me, I am quite
the same towards them; provided that you
always love me, I shall have no wish left in
the world; I have neither vanity nor
ambition, I have only love.”</p>

<p>The Count arrived at Niemirow very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
dissatisfied with his journey, and anxious
about the future. He had thought, from
what Hélène had said, that he would meet
with no opposition to a divorce on the part
of the Lignes, and instead of the consent
he expected, he had only received a very
decided refusal, accompanied by a severe
criticism of his own conduct, and of the
interested motives which, rightly or wrongly,
were attributed to him.</p>

<p>He had also fancied he would easily
obtain his wife’s consent by leaving her his
two sons; instead of this, his schemes were
baffled on all sides by very serious difficulties.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the position of the
Princess, who was living an isolated life,
almost hidden, it may be said, in one of the
Count’s residences, in the neighbourhood of
Niemirow, could no longer be endured without
serious inconvenience. The Comtesse Anna
was very much beloved in the country, her
two children inhabited Niemirow, and everybody
was beginning to wonder at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
prolonged absence; how much more extraordinary
would it appear when her husband
should return! All these reflections threw
the Count into a gloomy state of mind;
he made a short stay at Kowalowska, but
Hélène was pained by the coldness of his
manner, and the embarrassment he showed
during their first interview; he briefly
narrated the unsatisfactory results of his
journey, intimating that he could not remain
at Niemirow, and advising her to go to her
uncle’s and wait there for a solution which
was probably very remote.</p>

<p>Although the Count made these announcements
with a certain precaution, they produced
a terrible impression on the Princess.
She had behaved with the utmost good faith,
persuaded that, to obtain a divorce and marry
directly after, was the easiest thing in the
world. Her marriage would cover the imprudence
of her flight, and make every one
forget the conclusions they had drawn from
it. Suddenly she saw her dearest hopes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
vanish, her honour compromised, and the
man for whom she had sacrificed everything
calmly suggest that she should leave him,
perhaps for ever. The strain on her over-wrought
mind was too great, and she fainted.
When she came to herself her women only
were around her bed, for the Count had
returned to Niemirow. She wrote to him at
once: “When you left me I was in the
greatest despair, yet you never showed the
slightest feeling of pity. I can only say that
I shall find my life odious if you persist in
your intention of abandoning me. I appeal
to you for an account of my destiny thus
committed to your charge. Is it possible you
could dispose of it with so little reflection?”</p>

<p>Hélène in vain waited all day for a reply;
the Count did not answer. The next day
she received a few lines, saying that he
was ill. The Princess was not in the habit
of leaving Kowalowska, and had never
entered the residence where the children of
the Countess Anna were living. But in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
anxiety she forgot all prudence, and wrote as
follows: “I am in despair at hearing you are
ill; if you had sent me word sooner I should
have perhaps found means of coming to see
you. If you are unable to assist me otherwise,
send me the key of the small garden
gate; Saint Charles will follow me, and I will
come, for it is impossible for me to let to-day
pass without seeing you; I am in agony, and
besides I have letters I must show you.”</p>

<p>The Count’s illness was only too genuine.
The worry he had gone through during his
journey, the awkwardness of his position,
added to bodily fatigue, were probably its
cause. At the end of three days a putrid
fever of an alarming character declared itself,
and for three months he was in danger of
death.</p>

<p>The unhappy Hélène did not dare to take
her place at his bedside; she only went
secretly to his room in order to be certain
that every care was bestowed on him. The
Bishop of Wilna, on hearing what was taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
place, decided at last to write to his niece.
He urged her to come and settle near him
at Werky, and promised to forget her <i>past
imprudences</i> if she would renounce her <i>mad
infatuation for the Count</i>.</p>

<p>The Princess answered:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>—You must certainly
have heard of the Lord Chamberlain’s illness;
but what no one can tell you, and what I
myself can hardly express, is the fearful state
of despair I was in on seeing the only happiness
possible for me in this world on the very
brink of destruction.</p>

<p>“Now at last, after all my anxiety, he is
out of danger, and although he was on the
point of losing his life, I can truly assure you
that he does not recover from a worse state
than I do myself.</p>

<p>“Your letter arrived at the very moment
that we were beginning to take courage,
and to fancy that our union was still a
possibility; you will imagine my despair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
on seeing that you only speak of a
separation.</p>

<p>“I know your kindness of heart, my dear
uncle, and am persuaded that you have never
formed a plan without intending it to bring
about my happiness and tranquillity; I therefore
implore you, my dear uncle, not to consider
any plan feasible that should remove
me or oblige me to forsake the choice I have
made. Whatever reproach may be cast at
me, I am certain I do not deserve to be
blamed for want of firmness or constancy.
I am quite decided not to change anything
in my way of acting, even should the present
impediments last as long as my life. I therefore
beg you, my dear uncle, to vouchsafe me
a few words of comfort. Tell me that you wish
to see us happy, but do not tell us that we must
seek our happiness apart from each other.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my dear uncle; accept the
tribute of my deepest respect, and the tender
affection which I shall bear you through life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>After a convalescence which lasted as
long as his illness, the Count started for
Galicia. He had been touched by Hélène’s
despair, and by her devotion to him. On
leaving her he promised that he would again
make every effort to obtain the divorce so
ardently desired, and he left her, if not easy
in her mind, at least somewhat reassured.</p>

<p>The pacification of Flanders was an accomplished
fact, and in 1791 the Prince de Ligne,
accompanied by Prince Charles, officially
entered Mons as Grand Bailiff of Hainault.
A magnificent banquet, followed by a concert
and a ball, was given in their honour by the
States of Hainault, in the Town Hall.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Several poems were presented to the
Prince de Ligne by the students of the
college of Houdain and others. It is unnecessary
to say that the virtues of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
Prince and the glory of his son were the
chosen theme.</p>

<p>However, in the midst of this concert of
praise, one discordant note was heard. A
certain lawyer from Nivelle, called Masson,
published a libel on the occasion. “Amongst
several other things I have forgotten,” writes
the Prince, “he said that at my entry as
governor of Hainault I looked like an old
Sultan, surrounded by women, to whom I
devoted the whole of my attention, and that
I had been stupid enough to accept in good
faith acclamations of ‘Long live the Patriot
Prince.’ This last statement is true. It was
in a church, where I was either taking or
administering the oath. I accepted this cry
with the rest, without suspecting that its
utterer had any malicious intention. As for
the Sultan, he does me too much honour;
it is true that, during my tedious progress,
some very pretty girls threw bouquets into
my carriage, and the crowd obliging them to
stop near the door, I thanked them very much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
and told them they were charming. The
only reproach which might be considered not
quite unfounded was that concerning my
entry. The war had just ended, as well as
the rebellion in the Netherlands, both of
which had cost me a great deal of money.
I might have made debts and covered my
followers with gold lace; but I thought, on
the contrary, the people would be grateful to
me for not making too great a display. As
I had two Turks, four Hussars, several
bearded Russians, a Tartar with two dromedaries,
and a Turkish band, he might very
well compare me to Tamerlane or the Emperor
of China, though I do not remember
exactly which of the two I was supposed
to resemble.”</p>

<p>The Princes were very heartily received
by the inhabitants of the good town of Mons,
where they were much beloved; on the following
day they started with their family for Bel
Œil.</p>

<p>As soon as he was settled the first thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
the Prince did was to erect a monument in honour
of his beloved son Charles, to perpetuate
the memory of his brilliant conduct at Sabacz
and at Ismaïl. He designed it himself, chose
the site, and laid it out so as to imitate a spot
in the Empress’s gardens at Czarskoë-Celo.
“By following the left bank of the river,” he
says, “you come upon an obelisk dedicated by
Friendship to Valour. It is not my fault if
Charles is the hero of it; it is not my fault if
Charles distinguished himself in the war; it
is not my fault if I am the father of such a
perfect being. The father disappears, the
man remains, and the hero is celebrated; I
must not be accused of partiality, but I may
be accused of pride.”</p>

<p>This obelisk, in marble, is forty-five feet
high. On one side is inscribed, in gold
letters, the following: “To my dear Charles,
for Sabacz and Ismaïl;” on the second,
“<i>Nec te juvenis memoranda silebo</i>;” and on
the third, “His glory is my pride, his friendship
my happiness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>The de Lignes spent the summer at Bel
Œil, happy to be quiet and united once more
in the country they loved so well; but to an
attentive observer the tranquillity which
reigned in Flanders was not to be of long
duration; threatening symptoms might be
discerned on every side. The frightful progress
of the French revolution, and the
presence of the <i>émigrés</i> in the Netherlands,
caused anxiety in many minds.</p>

<p>Savoy, Switzerland, the Black Forest,
Liege, Treves, Luxemburg, and the Netherlands
were the first asylums of the persecuted;
it was only later on, when they had lost all
hope of a speedy return, that they went to
Vienna, London, Poland, and Russia. The
Archduchess Marie Christine, regent in the
Netherlands, was the sister of the Queen of
France; it was natural she should protect the
<i>émigrés</i>; but Leopold was not favourably
disposed towards them, and in the very beginning
of his reign he requested the Archduchess
Christine and the Electors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Mayence, Cologne, and Treves to do all in
their power to prevent the refugees and the
Princes from doing anything rash. “Do not
allow yourselves to be led into anything,”
he wrote; “do nothing the French or the
Princes ask you to do; meet them with
civilities and dinners, but give them neither
troops, money, nor help of any sort.” He
entirely separated the cause of the King
from that of the <i>émigrés</i>.</p>

<p>The Prince de Ligne was extremely ill-disposed
towards the Emperor Leopold; he
reproached him with having sucked the milk
of Italian dissimulation, and he would not
have anything to do with his pretended
political calculations. He adored the Queen,
and his heart leaped with indignation at the
thought of the dangers which daily threatened
her more and more.</p>

<p>He had vainly solicited a command in
the Austrian army. Leopold had carefully
avoided granting his request, for he feared
the imprudences his vivacity, his opinions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
and his chivalrous devotion might lead him
to commit.</p>

<p>We must admit that the Prince de Ligne
was no passionate admirer of liberty; he
very soon foresaw the tendencies of the
revolution, and in 1790 wrote to the Comte
de Ségur concerning the National Assembly:
“Greece had her philosophers, but they were
only seven; you have twelve hundred of them
at eighteen francs a day, having no mission
but what they arrogate to themselves, no
knowledge of foreign countries, no general
plan of operations, and not even the sea, which
is a sort of protection to the makers of empty
phrases, and to the laws of the country it
surrounds.”</p>

<p>The Prince never missed an opportunity
of showing his sympathy for the royal
family. One day he was present at a representation
of <i>Richard Cœur de Lion</i> at
the small theatre at Tournai. The public
was chiefly composed of French <i>émigrés</i>,
who were full of hope and illusion, impatiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
awaiting the time when they should
return to their country. The Prince could
not hear without emotion the air of: <i>O
Richard! Ô mon roi! l’univers t’abandonne</i>.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Tears came into his eyes, and the audience,
perceiving his emotion, frantically applauded.
“At that part,” says the Prince, “where the
promise is made to avenge the poor captive
king, I advanced, applauding as though I too
wished to contribute my efforts. I was in
earnest at the time, and it seemed likely that
my services would be accepted. Suddenly
the French ladies, both young and old, in the
excitement rushed out of their boxes, and the
whole of the pit, mostly consisting of young
French officers, jumped on the stage, crying
out: ‘Long live the King! Long live the
Prince de Ligne;’ and they only stopped
clapping their hands to wipe their eyes over-flowing
with tears.”</p>

<p>Among the young refugee officers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
were the most cordially received at Bel Œil
was M. de Villeneuve Laroche. He writes
in his Memoirs:<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> “The Prince de Ligne at
this time was residing with all his family at
Bel Œil, a fine estate distant one league from
the town of Ath; he took pleasure in conversing
with us about the principles of honour
that were the basis of our conduct, and he
commended us with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“He was good enough to invite me several
times to dine at his magnificent residence; I
may even go so far as to say that I formed
quite an intimacy with his eldest son, Prince
Charles, an officer of the very greatest
promise; he was a <i>colonel major</i> in the
artillery, and had lately distinguished himself
in the war against the Turks....</p>

<p>“The son sympathised with our feelings as
much as his father. He told me one day
that he had just written to the Emperor
asking to be employed in the coalition war,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
and added that if his request was rejected he
would serve as a mere volunteer with the
French nobility.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles had in fact urgently requested
to be allowed to return to the Austrian
army, with the rank of colonel in the
engineers. After the death of the Emperor
Leopold, which took place on the 27th
of February 1792, the Prince was given an
appointment in General Clairfayt’s army corps.
The Austrian general-in-chief was the Duke
Albert of Saxe-Teschen, husband of the
Archduchess Christine.</p>

<p>The campaign was opened against the
armies of the French republic; and already,
on the 27th of May, Prince Charles had
distinguished himself by his daring valour
in a fight that took place near Condé;
but no great battle was yet imminent. The
enemy confined himself to skirmishes; the
Duke Albert’s headquarters were at Mons,
and the inauguration of the new Emperor,
François II., as Count of Hainault, was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
take place in that town. Prince Charles de
Ligne was chosen to represent the sovereign
on this occasion.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>We read in the <i>Journal du Palais et
historique</i> of the councillor Paridaens the
following paragraph:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>7th June 1792.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“This day being a feast of the Holy
Sacrament, his Royal Highness the Duke
Albert of Saxe-Teschen, who is Governor-General
of the Netherlands, followed in the
procession. Several generals accompanied
him—among others, the Prince de Lambesc,
of the House of Lorraine, who had been transferred
from the French to the Austrian service,
and also the son of the Prince de Ligne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p class="right">
<i>9th June.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“On this day, Saturday, the Prince de
Ligne’s son, although quartered for some
time at Mons, made his official entry into
the town as Commissary to his Majesty
at the ceremony of Inauguration which is
to take place on the day after to-morrow.
Guns were fired, although we are at the very
seat of war. He entered on horseback by
the Havré gate, crossed the square, and
went up the Rue Neuve to the hôtel de
Ligne,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> while the bells were ringing. He
was followed by the dragoon officers of
the Coburg regiment, and by his liveried
retainers.</p>

<p>“However, as the French, who were
camped at Maubeuge, showed a disposition
to interfere in the ceremony of Inauguration,
and had in the last few days drawn nearer towards
Petit, Quévy, and even Bougnies, on the
evening of the 10th of June an attack was prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
and carried out at two o’clock in the morning.
There was a violent onset and sharp cannonading,
which lasted till five.”</p>
</div>

<p>Prince Charles, who would not have
missed this fight for anything in the world,
started off in the middle of the night at
the head of his regiment, despite the Archduke
Albert’s opposition. He fought with
his usual bravery, was very nearly taken
prisoner, having imprudently ventured too
far amidst the enemy; and at seven in the
morning, black with powder and heated with
the fight, he arrived on horseback, post
haste, barely in time to put on his full dress
uniform and get into his coach.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the Emperor’s Inauguration
as Count of Hainault is as old
as the days of Charlemagne, but this was the
last time that the traditional custom was to
be celebrated. We have seen the importance
attached to it by the States of Hainault at
the time of the Flemish insurrection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>At half-past eight all the clergy of Mons,
the ladies of the Chapter of Sainte Waudru,
following the shrine of the saint, who was
the patroness of Mons, all the magistrates,
the deputies of the town council, the chief
councillor of the Provinces in his State robes,
and the twenty-six deputies of the chief towns
in Hainault, preceded by magnificent banners
from all the parishes, embroidered in gold
and silk, took their places in the theatre.
At nine o’clock his Highness the Prince
Charles de Ligne left his hotel in a coach
drawn by six horses and preceded by a
detachment of dragoons, by the members of
the order of the nobility, each one in a coach
drawn by two horses, and by a herald-at-arms
on horseback, named O’Kelly, bearing his
coat-of-arms, and the cap and wand of
his office. The guards and officers of his
house closed the procession. On reaching
the theatre his Highness seated himself
on an arm-chair under a canopy, above which
was placed a portrait of his Majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>When all the different orders were
placed and seated, the trumpets sounded,
Murray’s regiment fired a volley of musketry,
the artillery on the ramparts answered by a
salute, and the herald-at-arms, advancing to
the front of the theatre, called <i>Silence</i>
three times. Then the Prince rose, and,
laying his hand on the Gospels, first took
the oath to the Chapter of Sainte Waudru,
of which he was named Abbot. The
Princesse de Croy, first lady of the Chapter,
presented to him the crozier, and a salute
of artillery and music and trumpets, etc., announced
to the people that the first act of the
ceremony had taken place. The Prince afterwards
took the oath to the States, in the
same manner; and finally, a third time to the
town of Mons, after which he solemnly
received the oaths of allegiance from the said
Chapter, States, and Town.</p>

<p>“During the ceremony,” says the councillor
Paridaens, “some national guards, taken
prisoners in that night’s encounter, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
brought to the square, and just as the procession
was threading its way to Sainte Waudru,
at the entrance of the road, it was met by the
generals who were returning from fighting
the French. At the head of these generals
was the Duc Albert de Saxe, with his nephew
the Archduke Charles,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> who had been under
fire for the first time in his life. At that
very moment the news arrived that M. de
Gouvion, Commander-in-Chief of the French
army, had been killed. It was vaguely known
that the French had been repulsed, after
having made, however, a good stand for the
first time. Indeed the cannon had been
heard without interruption from two o’clock
till six in the morning. On the 12th of June
H.R.H. Madame arrived about ten o’clock
in the morning. “On entering the rooms of
the Government House she heartily and repeatedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
embraced her nephew, the Archduke
Charles, as one might a friend whom one
sees for the first time after he has encountered
a great danger. I saw this from my
dining-room windows.”</p>

<p>The Prince gave a banquet that evening to
the principal town authorities; the Archdukes,
the Prince de Lambesc, and other generals
were present. On the following day he returned
to the camp, only too glad to have
done with a part so little in keeping with his
natural modesty. Two months went by,
events were succeeding each other in France
with the most startling rapidity, the position
of the royal family was becoming daily more
critical, till the terrible 10th of August induced
the Duke of Brunswick, commander-in-chief
of the allied forces, to alter his plan of campaign.
He decided to move on the army in
the direction of the gorge of Argonne, so as
to enter Champagne by Sainte Menehould,
and march on Paris by Châlons. He gave
orders to General Clairfayt to join him with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
twenty-five thousand men, who were to
form the right wing of his army. This
change of position on the part of Count
Clairfayt decided Dumouriez, then at the
camp of Maulde, to proceed to the plains
of Champagne with the greater part of his
army.</p>

<p>During the three months that had elapsed
since the inauguration at Mons no important
battle had afforded Prince Charles an opportunity
of distinguishing himself; but, gifted
with a sound judgment and an observant
mind, he had employed the interval in forming
a just estimate of the illusions entertained
by the <i>émigrés</i>, and of the very
imperfect description they had given of
the state of France. He wrote from the
camp at Boux a letter, which fell into the
hands of the republicans, and was read at a
public sitting of the Convention.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>“We are beginning to get tired of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
this war, in respect of which MM. <i>les émigrés</i>
had promised us more butter than bread.
We have to fight against troops of the line
who never desert, and national troops who
remain at their posts. The peasants, who
are armed, fire on our men, and if one of
them is found alone or asleep in a house he
is murdered. The weather, since our entry
into France, has been horrible; it rains
in torrents every day, and the roads are so
bad that at the present moment we cannot
move our cannon; moreover, we are almost
in a state of famine. We have the greatest
difficulty in obtaining bread for the soldiers,
and meat is often wanting; many of the
officers remain for five or six days without
warm food. Our shoes and cloaks are
rotten, and our men are beginning to fall
ill; the villages are deserted, and provide
neither vegetables, nor brandy, nor flour;
I do not know what we shall do, nor what
will become of us.”</p>

<p>This letter expresses a discouragement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
that must have been general, and circumstances
were favourable to Dumouriez in
preparing for the attack; but it was indispensable
that he should at any cost prevent the
allied army from occupying the Argonne pass.
The forest was impenetrable except by five
passages, which it was necessary to guard
and hold against the enemy. These passes
were the Chêne-Populeux, the Croix-au-Bois,
the Grand-Pré, the Chalade and the Islettes.
A camp placed at the Islettes and a position
taken up at the Chalade would close the two
principal roads to Clermont and to Varennes,
and General Dillon was despatched
for the purpose. Dumouriez established himself
at Grand-Pré, to close the roads to
Rheims and to the Croix-au-Bois. He sent
orders to General Duval, then at Pont-sur-Sambre,
to break up his camp at once and
advance by forced marches to the pass of the
Chêne-Populeux.</p>

<p>Dumouriez felt certain of success, but an
act of imprudence frustrated his hopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>The pass of the Croix-au-Bois had been
considered less important than the others,
and was only defended by a couple of battalions
of infantry and two squadrons of
cavalry. Dumouriez, in the stress of the
moment, had not had the time to see and
judge personally of the importance of this
pass, but the German spies, employed to
inspect the different French posts, informed
the Duke of Brunswick of the advantages of
this badly-guarded pass. Clairfayt confided
the attack to Prince Charles de Ligne, who
started on the 13th of September at early
dawn to seize it. The abatis intended
to bar the road had been carelessly made,
the half-buried branches not offering any
resistance to the enemy; the imperialists
easily forced a passage, and the roads had
been so slightly damaged that they made
their way at once. They met with hardly
any resistance, and easily carried the position.
The men who held it hastily fell back on
Dumouriez’s camp; the latter, anxious at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
turn things were taking, immediately despatched
two brigades of infantry, and six
squadrons of cavalry, to General Chazot, with
orders to recapture the pass at any cost.
Chazot spent the day without attacking, but,
on receiving fresh and urgent orders to risk
an attack, he opened fire on the morning of
the 14th.</p>

<p>The attack and the defence were vigorous;
six times the post was carried by the
French, and as often recaptured by the
Austrians. Prince Charles sees that in order
to keep the position it is necessary to capture
a French battery, which, cleverly placed, is
inflicting heavy losses on the Austrians. A
vigorous charge is necessary; the Prince
in person leads the attack on the battery;
eight men in the front rank are shot dead.
He dashes forward himself, the ninth,
but, shot through the head by a bullet, he
reels for a moment in the saddle, and falls
back dead.</p>

<p>The French regained possession of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
pass, and raised the body of the unfortunate
Prince. They found two gold chains with a
locket round his neck, and in his pocket an
unfinished letter.</p>

<p>Clairfayt, in despair at the cruel loss the
army had sustained, hastened to avenge it,
and took possession of the Croix-au-Bois.</p>

<p>He immediately claimed the body of the
Prince, and it was at once given up. Mass was
celebrated in the camp the following morning,
and the coffin started for Mons. At that
moment M. de Villeneuve Laroche, a guest
at Bel Œil, and a friend of Prince Charles,
arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>“On the battlefield,” he says, “where
yesterday the republicans were defeated, I
met a funeral procession, escorted by a few
foreign troops, going in the direction of
Hainault. It was that of the young Prince
de Ligne, who was killed in the fight, and the
body was being taken to his unhappy father
at Bel Œil.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles’s death was universally deplored;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
his brilliant military qualities caused
him to be regretted by the whole army; the
Baron de Breteuil wrote from Verdun to the
Comte de Fersen: “Yesterday Clairfayt’s
army came in for a sharp fight at the outposts,
in which, however, it was victorious.
Clairfayt’s army lost in the attack five or six
hundred men, but what deeply affects me is
that Prince Charles de Ligne was killed. I
loved him from a child; he was the most distinguished
amongst the Austrians of the same
age. His father will feel the loss terribly.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles’s body was conveyed to
Bel Œil, after passing through Mons<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> at
night, but his father was no longer there;
he had been recalled, with Marshal de
Lascy, to Vienna.</p>

<p>When the terrible news arrived no one dared
to tell him of it, and the Marshal alone had the
courage to undertake the delicate mission.
He sent the Prince word that he had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
bad news from Clairfayt’s army, adding that
he would himself come and inform him of it.
“My son is wounded!” said the Prince as
the Marshal entered. The latter remained
silent. “But speak, good God!...”—“Alas!
I would not, or I could not, understand,”
he writes, “when he said that dreadful
word: <i>Dead!</i>... I feel crushed by the
news, and he had almost to carry me away
in his arms. I see it still, the spot where I
was when the Marshal told me that my poor
Charles was killed; I see my poor Charles
himself, as he welcomed me every day with
the sunshine of his happy and good face. I
had dreamt a few days before that he had
received a mortal wound in the head, and had
fallen dead from his horse. For five or six
days I was anxious, but as one always treats
as a weakness that which is often a warning,
or perhaps a feeling of nature when there are
ties of blood, I cast from my thoughts the
fatal foreboding which was only too soon to
be realised!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>The Prince never got over his son’s
death, and he entirely lost all enjoyment in
life. This sad recollection had made in his
heart a deep and incurable wound. “That
so light-hearted a man,” says Count Ouvaroff,
“who had lived through so much and was so
careless of misfortune, should ten years after
this calamity break down at the bare mention
of the beloved name! No one dared utter
it in his presence; if he happened to speak
of his son his voice would betray the
intensity of his grief, and his eyes fill
with tears.” There is something strangely
touching in this picture of the old man,
formerly so worldly and sceptical, as we
should say nowadays, who <i>would not be
comforted</i> because he still thought of the
child of his heart who was no longer.
“There is,” said the Prince with admirable
philosophy, when shortly after he lost all
his fortune, “there is a terrible method of
rising above circumstances. It is bought
at the cost of a great grief. If the soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
has been wounded by the loss of all that
is dearest, I defy minor misfortunes to
touch it; loss of wealth, total ruin, persecutions,
injustice, everything sinks into
insignificance.”</p>

<p>The unhappy Prince de Ligne had immediately
sent to Bel Œil the necessary
instructions for his son’s last wishes to be
fulfilled, but the victory of Jemappes, which
ceded the whole of Belgium to the French,
prevented the de Ligne family from returning
to Bel Œil, now in the hands of the
enemy. Prince Charles’s wishes were contained
in a will written shortly before his
death. We shall see that he instinctively
felt he would fall a victim in the course
of this war. Perhaps, indeed, weary of
life, he sought death, for he seemed to
brave it; at all events the deepest
melancholy overshadows the following
pages:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Prince Charles de Ligne’s Will.</span></p>

<p>“As I shall most probably be killed, if
not in this war at least in some other, I
wish my body to be recovered and my
funeral to be conducted with all the honours
of war, and with the greatest pomp—military,
of course.</p>

<p>“I wish my body to be carried to Bel
Œil, after having been embalmed, so as
not to incommode any one, for I desire to
be laid with my good ancestors, who from
father to son have all been honest men.</p>

<p>“I desire that my heart be wrapped up
separately in a handkerchief which shall
have belonged to her I love, and which I beg
her to give for that purpose. As she has
always possessed my heart during my lifetime,
I wish it, after my death, to be as happy as a
heart can be in the absence of the beloved one,
that is to say, in company with something that
has been her’s. I beg her to embroider
on the first corner of the handkerchief <i>Alona</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
on the second <i>Tendresse delicieuse</i>; on the
third <i>Indissoluble</i>; and on the fourth the 21st
September 1787, and the date of my death.</p>

<p>“I.—The whole of my collection of engravings,
my collection of original drawings,
and in general all the contents of my portfolios,
are to be sold to the best purchaser.
One will have to see in what country the
sale will be most advantageous, whether in
Paris, Vienna, London, or Amsterdam.</p>

<p>“<i>Nota bene.</i>—Should any of my family
wish to have these, he can take them at the
estimated value, which, however, cannot be
less than a hundred thousand German florins;
for the drawings are really priceless, as I
have none of inferior value, and all are
recognised originals. This will, therefore,
bring in a clear sum of a hundred thousand
florins, which will be completely my own,
and quite independent of the succession due
to my natural heirs, which I leave to them
according to law. This sum of a hundred
thousand florins is to be divided into two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
parts: eighty thousand are to be sunk in
an annuity for the benefit of my natural
daughter Christine, so that there will be
eight thousand florins a year for her keep
and education, which, up to the age of fifteen,
may be five hundred florins, and a thousand
florins up to the age of twenty, at which
time she will probably be married, and can
then spend her money as she chooses: In
such a manner, however, that she shall not
spend more than eight thousand florins; and
that all the money saved on this sum, up to
the age of twenty or five-and-twenty, if she
does not marry before, shall be placed out
at four or five per cent interest; this will
become her children’s property, care being
taken always to add the interest to the
capital.</p>

<p>“II.—Should she die without children,
Norokos is to be her heir. As I am the
adopted father of Norokos, the Turkish child
I found abandoned during the war, the remaining
sum of twenty thousand florins out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
of the hundred thousand realised by the
sale shall be sunk in the same way on his
account. The directions as to its use are
the same as for little Christine. Should he
die without children, Christine is to be his
heir. I recommend their marrying, if they
have any inclination one for the other; it is
my greatest wish, and I beg my sister
Christine to encourage this. I appoint her
their guardian, and in default of my sister
Christine, I appoint Madame la Comtesse
Thérèse Dietrichstein, formerly married to
Comte de Kinsky. I bequeath also to little
Christine the portrait of her mother, painted
by Le Clerc, and the chain I wear round
my neck, with the following words on the
clasps: ‘Ces liens me sont chers’ (these
ties are precious to me). I beg her never
to part with it, but always to wear it as a
remembrance of myself and of the person
who gave it to me.</p>

<p>“III.—My dispositions for the servants.</p>

<p>“I bequeath to Norokos my damaskeened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
Turkish gun with gold mountings, and my
sabre with the steel guard—the one I carried
during this war, in order that he may
remember that it is to war he owes his
condition; that he must look upon a military
career as his fortune, his element; and upon
the army as his country.</p>

<p>“IV.—I bequeath to my father the small
painting by Le Clerc and M. Duvivier’s drawing,
both representing the fight at Pösig, and
I beg that my crosses of the orders of Merit
and that of Saint George be suspended from
them, since I won them by my father’s example;
and as also I owe the happiness of
having acquired some friends in the army
through listening to all Lieutenant Wolff said
to my father when dying, and remembering
it all my life.</p>

<p>“V.—I bequeath to my sister Christine
all my framed drawings, with the miniatures,
cameos, and small frames.</p>

<p>“VI.—I bequeath to my daughter Sidonie
her mother’s portrait, so that she may remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
not to follow her example, and the
Turkish sabre given me by Prince Potemkin,
which she is always to keep in her room,
so that her children may understand that I
intend them to become soldiers; when her
son fights his first battle, in which, I trust,
he will distinguish himself, she will give him
this sabre from me.</p>

<p>“VII.—I bequeath to Madame de Kinsky,
who was Countess Dietrichstein by birth, all
the framed engravings I have in my apartment
at Bel Œil, and also the chain I wear
round my neck which was given me by her
dearest friend; I venture, on this account, to
beg that she will wear it all her life, in
remembrance of one whose happiness was
bound up with that of Madame de Kinsky;
this I positively affirm.</p>

<p>“VIII.—I bequeath to Madame la
Princesse de Lichtenstein, a Mandesch by
birth, several things I have at Brussels,
which will be described later on, and besides
these my watch, as a token that the happiest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
hours it has told are those I spent with her,
and that to the very last I thought of her as
a friend whose place in my heart was next to
the one I have always adored.</p>

<p>“IX.—I bequeath to the Princess Jablonowska,
Countess Czaski by birth, several
things I have at Brussels, which will hereafter
be named, and also the ring I always wear
with the motto ‘Indissoluble,’ the small portfolio
with the chain, and the other portfolios
or caskets containing letters and manuscripts
written by myself. I give this last proof
of my confidence to her who has most
claims on my gratitude for past kindness,
who has best understood the nature of my
thoughts, of my troubles,—in short, to a true
friend, whom I am sure not to forget even in
the other world.</p>

<p>“X.—I bequeath to the Princess Linowska,
Thun by birth, my fine edition of Shakespeare’s
works, and the best English horse in
my stable, on condition that it will be kept
exclusively for her use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“XI.—I bequeath to Mademoiselle Caroline
de Thun my eight handsome silver
candlesticks, and my handsome coffee-pot,
and besides this an annuity of twenty ducats,
in order that she may procure for herself
wherever she goes, and even in the house
which she most frequents, the best arm-chair
or couch that can possibly be made.</p>

<p>“XII.—I bequeath to Madame de Woina<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
a table and a tea-service, in order that she may
remember the pleasure I had in going to take
tea with her; also two Turkish sabres for her
children, Maurice and Felix.</p>

<p>“XIII.—I bequeath to my good friend
Poniatowski, my sabre set with Marshal
Laudon’s stone, and also the shoulder belt,
requesting him to wear it should he meet the
enemy, in honour of one who to save his life
would willingly have sacrificed his own.
Also my fine horse Winer, so that he may be
cared for all his life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>
<p>“XIV.—I bequeath to my brother Louis
the King of Poland’s sabre and Marlborough’s
pistols.</p>

<p>“XV.—I bequeath to my friend François,
Comte de Dietrichstein, the arms found with
me if I am killed, or that belong to me should
I die a natural death, excepting those disposed
of by special legacies; I beg him to collect
and distribute the above-named legacies, and
I am certain that he will not leave my body
to the enemy. Should, however, an accident
intervene, such as his being wounded himself,
he must neglect nothing in having it
reclaimed, with the chains and other things
I wear on my person.</p>

<p>“XVI.—The portraits of Mesdames de
Kinsky, Lichtenstein, Jablonowska, Linowska,
and Caroline, as well as Poniatowski’s and
that of Madame de Woina, which I request
may be obtained, shall be placed in my apartment
in the tower at Bel Œil, where I have
already placed the coloured prints belonging
to Madame de Kinsky. My wife’s portrait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
is to be previously removed and placed in the
lumber-room. This chamber is to become a
Temple to Friendship, and over the door shall
be inscribed the words: <i>Abode of the inseparable</i>.</p>

<p>“I request that my bust shall be placed on
a pedestal in the centre of the tower, and
turned in the direction of Madame de Kinsky’s
portrait, and I beg my father to compose and
have engraved on this pedestal some verses
describing the happiness I have enjoyed in her
society; but they must not contain any praise
of myself; under each portrait he will write in
verse a description of the person represented.</p>

<p>“XVII.—Arrangements for my household
(not copied).</p>

<p>“XVIII.—I bequeath to Madame de
Kinsky my good dog Tristan, that he may
be taken good care of; he has been treated
by me as I was by her, like a good and ever-faithful
dog.”</p>

<p><i>Note added by the Countess Dietrichstein.</i>—“The
body was embalmed, and, considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
the circumstances, sent to Bel Œil by mail
coach. A Mass was said at the headquarters
at Boux, in the presence of all the officers;
and orders were given that the last honours
should be rendered to his memory on the
passage of the coffin through Mons, where
he was well known and beloved.</p>

<p>“In order to carry out his wishes as much
as possible, the handkerchief will be placed
in his coffin; the date he asks for is unfortunately
from the 21st of September 1787 to the
14th of September 1792.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the mysterious reserve
with which the Prince expresses himself, it
is difficult not to believe that Madame de
Kinsky was the secret object of his deep
attachment. On reading his last wishes, so
imbued with nobleness, tenderness, and generosity,
we wonder how Hélène could have so
misunderstood him, and obliged him as it
were to transfer his affection to another.
Perhaps she was not entirely responsible
for their disunion; a mother or a friend like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
Madame de Rochechouart might have
guarded her at the outset from many an
imprudent step. It was impossible to expect
experience and wisdom in a child of fifteen.
During the last two years she had begun to
feel how dearly they are purchased.</p>

<p>All this time Hélène had remained alone
at Kowalowska. Notwithstanding the imprudences
her passion for the Count had
led her to commit, she had never for one
moment entertained any other idea than that
of marriage, though she knew in what light
her conduct was judged by the world.</p>

<p>Mortified and discouraged, Hélène was
giving herself up to the gloomiest ideas, when
she suddenly received the news of her husband’s
death. The sudden transition from
despair to joy stunned her at first; but soon
only one feeling possessed her soul, that of
her freedom, and she hurriedly wrote these
few lines to the Count:—</p>

<p>“A cannon-ball has carried off Prince
Charles. I am free; it is God’s will: <i>This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
cannon was loaded from all eternity!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> And
absorbed in the selfishness of her passion, she
did not for one instant regret the first companion
of her life, or shed a tear for the father
of her child. His glorious and touching end
did not inspire her with an atom of pity.</p>

<p>And then, as if, indeed, death had received
from God the mission of removing all possible
obstacles to Hélène’s happiness, a few days
later the second son of the Countess Anna
died of a gangrenous sore throat, before his
unhappy mother was able to reach him; and
that nothing might be wanting to complete
the romance, the Princess heard almost at
the same moment of the death of her brother
Xavier, leaving her heiress to an income of
six hundred thousand livres.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The Count had reached Niemirow in time
to see his son, of whom, it must be added,
Hélène had taken the utmost care. He wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
in all haste to the Countess Anna to tell her
the fatal news, and then in another letter he
announced to her Prince Charles’s death, and
offered to give her back at once her eldest
son, François, in exchange for her consent to
their divorce. The unfortunate woman resisted
no longer, she only begged that the
legal forms should be carefully observed in
obtaining the consent of the Court of Rome,
hoping that in the interval her husband might
return to her before the last step was taken.
Directly after his mother’s answer the little
Count François, accompanied by his governess
and servants, started to meet her.</p>

<p>Without loss of time Hélène wrote to her
uncle, whose character she well understood;
she told him of her husband’s death, and
implored his aid for the settlement of her
brother’s affairs; she ended by asking him
to see Count Vincent, who would be able to
explain many important details difficult to
negotiate in writing. She sent this letter to
the Prince-Bishop by Major Hoffman, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
Polish gentleman attached to the service of
the Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p>The embassy was a complete success.
The prelate, calculating that Count Vincent
Potocki living would be infinitely more useful
to him than the Prince de Ligne dead, wrote
to the Count, and begged him to come and
see him when he should next go to Warsaw,
and in the meanwhile offered to receive his
niece at Werky. Hélène sent the following
reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>December 1792.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My very dear and very honoured
Uncle</span>—It is with the deepest gratitude that
I received through Major Hoffman the assurance
of your paternal disposition towards
me. It has awakened in me the warmest and
strongest feelings. Pray receive, my dear
uncle, my compliments and my thanks.
Many things at present prevent my going
to see you as I should wish, but as soon as,
by the grace of God, I am able to do so, I
shall have the honour of presenting myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
in person, and reiterating to you the deep
respect with which I have the honour to
subscribe myself, my very dear and revered
uncle, your very humble and obedient servant
and niece,</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">“<span class="smcap">Hélène Massalska</span>,</span><br>
“Rowager-Princesse de Ligne.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Then she wrote to the Count Vincent:
“I do not advise you to await the arrival of
the Prince-Bishop before writing to him, for
he is one of those persons who never know
when they will start or when they will arrive.
You could send a messenger to Werky, who
would wait for an answer, which might perhaps
hurry on matters; but if the Prince-Bishop
could see you, he would do every
thing you wish, and we should be happy.”</p>

<p>The Count did not make up his mind
to go, and Hélène, fearing his capricious
and irresolute character, went to Werky herself.
She entreated her uncle to apply to
the Pope, so as to hasten the formalities
necessary for the divorce, for she was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
daily fear that the project on which she had
set her heart should fall through.</p>

<p>Everything took place in accordance with
the Princess’s wishes, and <i>three months</i> after
the death of Prince Charles de Ligne the
marriage of Hélène and Count Potocki was
celebrated at midnight in the Chapel of the
Convent of the Bernadines near Werky.
The apparent motive of this secrecy was the
Princess’s mourning, as yet too recent to
allow of an official wedding; but it must be
added that the permission for a divorce had
not yet arrived from Rome, and only came
three months later. It required all the influence
of the Prince-Bishop to obtain a priest
that should celebrate the marriage under such
conditions.</p>

<p>On entering the Chapel, and at the moment
of realising the happiness she so ardently desired,
Hélène experienced the deepest emotion,
mingled with a vague sense of terror. She
knelt beside the Count, and remained motionless,
her eyes fixed on the ground, and absorbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
in her thoughts. When the Count
gave her his hand to lead her to the altar
she rose to her feet, but suddenly stopped
short, with a fixed and terrified gaze, a prey
to the most terrible hallucination. By the
flickering light of the wax tapers she fancied
she saw three coffins laid across her path,
which she would have to step over on her
way to the altar. The Count, appalled at
Hélène’s terrified look, inquired in a low
voice the cause of her alarm; the sound of
his voice recalled her to herself, and, chasing
away the horrible vision by a strong effort of
will, she resolutely ascended the three steps
of black marble, which a moment before had
presented such a sinister appearance. The
bridal pair returned to Werky, and the
terrible moment was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>After a prolonged stay in Lithuania, during
which the Lord Chamberlain visited his wife’s
extensive domains, they both returned to
Ukrania, and Hélène triumphantly entered
the Count’s abode, whither she had gone in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
such fear and trembling at the time of his illness.
The past and all its sorrows were forgotten,
and, radiant with happiness, she wrote
to her husband, who was absent for a few days:
“To-morrow I shall see you again, and see
you still the same, for I do not want you ever
to change in the smallest degree: virtues,
attractions, wit, faults, caprices, all are
precious to me; if you were more perfect,
you would no longer be the Vincent for whose
sake I should have been guilty of the greatest
folly, if kind heaven had not permitted that
all should be for the best in the end.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
